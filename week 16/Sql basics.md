# 🚀What is MySQL?

**MySQL** is an **open-source relational database management system (RDBMS)** developed by **Oracle Corporation**. It uses **SQL (Structured Query Language)** for accessing, managing, and manipulating data stored in databases.

---

### 🔹 Let's Break Down the Definition:

#### 1. ✅ **Relational Database**:

A relational database stores data in **tables** (like spreadsheets) where each row is a **record** and each column is a **field** or **attribute**. Relationships between tables are maintained using **foreign keys**.

#### 2. ✅ **Database Management System (DBMS)**:

It’s software that:

- **Stores data** securely.
    
- **Allows retrieval** and updates.
    
- **Handles user access, permissions**, backups, etc.  
    MySQL is a type of **DBMS** that follows the **relational model**.
    

#### 3. ✅ **SQL (Structured Query Language)**:

The language used to interact with MySQL. You use SQL to:

- Create databases/tables
    
- Insert, update, delete, and query data
    
- Set permissions
    
- And more
    

---

### 🔹 Why Use MySQL?

- 🆓 **Open-source** (Free to use, with paid enterprise support options).
    
- 🚀 **Fast performance** for many applications.
    
- 🧩 **Cross-platform** (Works on Windows, Linux, MacOS).
    
- 💪 **Scalable** — from small apps to massive enterprise-level systems.
    
- 🔒 **Secure** — supports encryption, access control, user authentication.
    
- 🔗 Used with popular tech stacks like **LAMP** (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).

```sql
CREATE DATABASE studentDB;
```

#### 📌 Creating a Table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
);
```

#### 📌 Inserting Data:

```sql
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'John', 22);
```

#### 📌 Querying Data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students;
```

#### 📌 Updating Data:

```sql
UPDATE students SET age = 23 WHERE id = 1;
```

#### 📌 Deleting Data:

```sql
DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 1;
```

---

### 🧠 Summary

> **MySQL** is a powerful, fast, and reliable RDBMS that allows developers and businesses to store and manage data in a structured and secure way. It’s widely used in web development and continues to evolve with modern use cases.


 
# 🚀MySQL Components Hierarchy (In-depth)

### 🔹 1. **Server**

- The **MySQL Server** is the running engine that handles all requests — connecting to databases, processing SQL queries, managing users, and storing data.
    
- When you start MySQL on your machine or connect remotely, you are talking to the MySQL server.
    

---

### 🔹 2. **Database**

**💡 Similar to MongoDB "Database"**

- A **Database** is like a container. It holds tables, views, stored procedures, etc.
    
- You can have multiple databases on one MySQL server.
    

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_app;
USE my_app;
```

💡 You switch between databases using `USE`.

---

### 🔹 3. **Table**

**💡 Similar to MongoDB "Collection"**

- A **Table** stores **structured data** in rows and columns.
    
- Each table is defined by a **schema** (column names, data types, constraints).
    
- Tables can be related to each other (hence **Relational** database).
    

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

✅ Each table is like a spreadsheet with:

- **Columns**: attributes (name, email, age)
    
- **Rows**: actual records/data
    

---

### 🔹 4. **Row (Record)**

**💡 Similar to MongoDB "Document"**

- Each **row** is a single record.
    
- It has values for each column in the table.
    

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Achyuth', 'achyuth@gmail.com');
```

Now this row is stored in the `users` table.

---

### 🔹 5. **Column**

- Each **column** defines a field in the table (like `name`, `email`, `age`).
    
- Columns have **data types** (e.g., `VARCHAR`, `INT`, `DATE`, etc.).
    
- Columns can also have **constraints** (like `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `PRIMARY KEY`).
    

---

### 🔹 6. **Constraints**

Used to enforce rules on the data in tables:

|Constraint|Description|
|---|---|
|`PRIMARY KEY`|Uniquely identifies each row|
|`FOREIGN KEY`|Creates a relationship between tables|
|`UNIQUE`|Ensures all values in a column are different|
|`NOT NULL`|Field must have a value|
|`CHECK`|Ensures value satisfies a condition|
|`DEFAULT`|Sets a default value if none is provided|

---

### 🔹 7. **Relationships**

**💡 This is where MySQL differs from MongoDB.**

- In MySQL, you **connect tables** using **foreign keys**.
    
- For example, a `posts` table might have a `user_id` that references the `users` table.
    

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  user_id INT,
  content TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

✅ Now each post **belongs to a user** — this is how MySQL handles structured relational data.

---

### 🔹 8. **Indexes**

Indexes help **speed up queries** (like searching for a user by email).

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_email ON users(email);
```

Without indexes, MySQL would scan the entire table (slow for large data).

---

### 🔹 9. **Views** (Optional but powerful)

- A **View** is a **virtual table** created by a SQL query.
    
- It doesn’t store data but can simplify complex queries.
    

```sql
CREATE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE status = 'active';
```

---

### 🔹 10. **Stored Procedures / Functions**

- These are **predefined SQL code blocks** that you can run repeatedly.
    
- Great for logic that’s executed often (like auto-billing, calculations, etc.).
    

---

### 🔹 11. **Users and Permissions**

- MySQL supports **user accounts** with different access levels (read-only, full control, etc.).
    

```sql
CREATE USER 'achyuth'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password123';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON my_app.* TO 'achyuth'@'localhost';
```

---

## 🧠 TL;DR Summary Table:

|MongoDB Concept|MySQL Equivalent|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Server|Server|The software engine|
|Database|Database|Logical container|
|Collection|Table|Stores rows of structured data|
|Document|Row|A single data record|
|Field|Column|Data attribute|
|Index|Index|Speeds up search|
|N/A|Foreign Key|Defines relationship|
|N/A|Constraints|Validations like NOT NULL, etc.|
|N/A|Views, Procedures|Logic handling tools|

# 🚀USE  command in mysql

In **MySQL**, the `USE` command is used to **select a specific database** so that you can work inside it — without having to type the database name every time.

---

### 📘 **Syntax:**

```sql
USE database_name;
```

---

### 🔍 **What It Does:**

- It tells MySQL, “Hey, I want to work inside this database now.”
    
- Once you run it, any table queries (like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, etc.) will be **applied to that database** unless you switch again.
    

---

### 🧠 **Example:**

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
-- Let's say you see a database called `shop_db`

USE shop_db;

-- Now you can run:
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM products;
```

Without `USE`, you'd need to type:

```sql
SELECT * FROM shop_db.products;
```

every time.

---

### ⚠️ Important Notes:

- `USE` doesn't return a result — it just sets the **context**.
    
- Only one database can be “in use” at a time in a session.
    

---

### TL;DR:

✅ `USE` sets the **current working database**, so you don’t have to fully qualify every table name.



# 🚀SELECT command in mysql


## 🔍 **What is the `SELECT` Command in SQL?**

The `SELECT` command is used to **retrieve data** from one or more tables in a relational database. It’s like asking the database:  
👉 _“Hey, give me this specific data from this specific place, under these specific conditions.”_

It doesn’t modify or delete anything — just **reads and returns** what you ask for.

The parts like `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` are called **SQL clauses** — each one performs a specific role in shaping your query.

---

## ⚙️ **Full Syntax Structure of SELECT**

```sql
SELECT [DISTINCT] column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
[WHERE condition]
[GROUP BY column]
[HAVING condition]
[ORDER BY column [ASC|DESC]]
[LIMIT number];
```

Let’s break down each part:

---

### 1. ✅ **SELECT**

Specifies the columns you want to retrieve.

```sql
SELECT name, age FROM users;
```

→ Fetches only `name` and `age` columns.

You can also use `*` to select **all columns**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

---

### 2. ✅ **DISTINCT**

Removes **duplicate** values in the result set.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM users;
```

→ Returns each city **only once**, even if multiple users live there.

---

### 3. ✅ **FROM**

Specifies **which table** to get the data from.

```sql
SELECT * FROM products;
```

You can also **join multiple tables** here (more on joins later).

---

### 4. ✅ **WHERE**

Filters rows based on **conditions**.

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18;
```

Supports conditions like:

- `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
    
- `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `LIKE`, `IS NULL`
    

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE city IN ('Mumbai', 'Delhi');
```

---

### 5. ✅ **ORDER BY**

Sorts the results.

```sql
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price ASC;
```

You can sort by **multiple columns** too:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY age DESC, name ASC;
```

---

### 6. ✅ **LIMIT**

Limits the number of rows returned.

```sql
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5;
```

Useful for pagination or testing queries.

---

### 7. ✅ **GROUP BY**

Used when you want to **aggregate data** (e.g., totals, averages).

```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY city;
```

This groups users **by city**, and counts how many users are in each.

---

### 8. ✅ **HAVING**

Filters **grouped** data (used after `GROUP BY`).

```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY city HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```

You can't use `WHERE` here — `HAVING` is for groups.

---

### 9. ✅ **Functions with SELECT**

SQL has built-in **aggregate functions**:

|Function|What It Does|
|---|---|
|`COUNT()`|Counts rows|
|`SUM()`|Adds up values|
|`AVG()`|Averages values|
|`MIN()`|Finds minimum|
|`MAX()`|Finds maximum|

Example:

```sql
SELECT AVG(price) FROM products;
```

---

### 10. ✅ **Aliases (AS)**

Rename columns or tables in your output.

```sql
SELECT first_name AS name FROM users;
```

---

### 11. ✅ **Joins (Advanced Usage)**

You can use SELECT to pull data from **multiple tables**.

```sql
SELECT orders.id, users.name
FROM orders
JOIN users ON orders.user_id = users.id;
```

---

## 🧠 Real-World Example:

> "Show the top 3 products that cost more than ₹1000, sorted by price descending."

```sql
SELECT name, price
FROM products
WHERE price > 1000
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

---

## 🔥 Summary Table

|Clause|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`SELECT`|Pick the columns you want|
|`FROM`|Choose the table(s)|
|`WHERE`|Filter rows before grouping|
|`GROUP BY`|Group rows for aggregation|
|`HAVING`|Filter grouped data|
|`ORDER BY`|Sort the result|
|`LIMIT`|Limit number of rows|

---




# 🚀What is an **Alias** in MySQL?

An **alias** is a temporary name you give to a **column** or a **table** — usually to make the output easier to read or to simplify complex queries.

It doesn’t change the actual database — it's just for display or temporary use **within that query**.

---

### 🧾 Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
```

OR

```sql
SELECT column_name alias_name
FROM table_name;
```

Yes bro, the `AS` keyword is **optional**, but using it makes things more readable.

---

### ✅ Example 1: Column Alias

```sql
SELECT first_name AS Name, age AS Age
FROM students;
```

🧠 Output will look like:

```
+--------+-----+
| Name   | Age |
+--------+-----+
| Achyuth|  21 |
| Yadav  |  20 |
```

---

### ✅ Example 2: Table Alias

```sql
SELECT s.first_name, m.marks
FROM students AS s
JOIN marks AS m ON s.id = m.student_id;
```

Here, `s` and `m` are just shortcuts for the table names inside the query. Saves typing & looks cleaner.

---

### 🔥 When to use aliases?

|Use Case|Why?|
|---|---|
|Long column/table names|Makes queries shorter|
|Same table joined twice|Prevents confusion|
|Complex functions|For readability|
|Subqueries or derived tables|Almost always needs alias|

---

### 🧨 Without Alias vs With Alias:

```sql
-- Without alias:
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) 
FROM students;

-- With alias:
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name 
FROM students;
```

🧠 With alias, you get the output header as `full_name` instead of a long ugly function.

---




# 🚀**What is the `WHERE` Clause?**

The `WHERE` clause is used to **filter records** in SQL statements.  
Only rows that satisfy the condition will be selected, updated, or deleted.

---

## 🔨 **Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

---

## ✅ **Common Uses:**

### 1. **Filter rows based on values**

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE grade = 'A';
```

> Returns only students with grade A.

---

### 2. **Use with comparison operators**

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE price > 500;
```

> Gets all products that cost more than 500.

Operators you can use:

- `=` (equal)
    
- `!=` or `<>` (not equal)
    
- `>` / `<` / `>=` / `<=`
    

---

### 3. **Use with logical operators**

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE age > 18 AND city = 'Kochi';
```

> Filters users over 18 and from Kochi.

- `AND` – all conditions must be true
    
- `OR` – at least one must be true
    
- `NOT` – reverses condition
    

---

### 4. **Pattern matching with `LIKE`**

```sql
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE title LIKE 'Harry%';
```

> Gets all books starting with "Harry"

- `%` = any number of characters
    
- `_` = exactly one character
    

---

### 5. **Check range using `BETWEEN`**

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE amount BETWEEN 1000 AND 5000;
```

> Orders with amount between 1K and 5K

---

### 6. **Check list using `IN`**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department IN ('IT', 'HR', 'Finance');
```

> Filters people in specific departments

---

### 7. **Use with `UPDATE` or `DELETE`**

```sql
UPDATE students
SET marks = marks + 5
WHERE attendance > 90;
```

```sql
DELETE FROM users
WHERE status = 'inactive';
```

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

|Clause|Use|
|---|---|
|`WHERE`|Filters individual rows before any grouping or sorting|


# 🚀`BETWEEN`, `IN`, `LIKE`, `REGEXP`, and `IS NULL`.
## 1️⃣ **BETWEEN**

### 🔧 Use: Filter values **within a range** (inclusive)

### ✅ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```

### 💡 Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 50000;
```

🧠 **Explanation**:  
This returns all employees whose salary is **greater than or equal to 30,000** and **less than or equal to 50,000**.

> 👉 Equivalent to: `salary >= 30000 AND salary <= 50000`

---

## 2️⃣ **IN**

### 🔧 Use: Match **multiple specific values**

### ✅ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

### 💡 Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE grade IN ('A', 'B', 'C');
```

🧠 **Explanation**:  
This returns students who got either grade A, B, or C.  
Perfect when you need to **check a list** instead of writing multiple OR conditions.

> 👉 Equivalent to: `grade = 'A' OR grade = 'B' OR grade = 'C'`

---

## 3️⃣ **LIKE**

### 🔧 Use: Match **patterns in text**

### ✅ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE 'pattern';
```

### 🔹 Wildcards:

- `%` = any number of characters
    
- `_` = exactly one character
    

### 💡 Examples:

```sql
-- Names starting with 'Jo'
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE name LIKE 'Jo%';

-- Names ending in 'son'
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE name LIKE '%son';

-- Names with 4 letters starting with 'A'
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE name LIKE 'A___';
```

🧠 **Explanation**:  
LIKE is useful when you're not looking for **exact matches**, but instead want to match a **pattern**.

---

## 4️⃣ **REGEXP (or REGEX / RLIKE)**

### 🔧 Use: **Advanced pattern matching** (like more powerful LIKE)

### ✅ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column_name REGEXP 'pattern';
```

### 💡 Examples:

```sql
-- Names that start with A or B
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE name REGEXP '^[AB]';

-- Names ending in 'son' or 'sen'
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE name REGEXP 'son$|sen$';

-- Emails with gmail or yahoo
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE email REGEXP 'gmail|yahoo';
```

🧠 **Explanation**:  
`REGEXP` is like **LIKE on steroids** — it supports full **regular expressions**, so you can match very complex patterns.

> Tip: Use when `LIKE` just isn’t enough.

---

## 5️⃣ **IS NULL / IS NOT NULL**

### 🔧 Use: Check for **missing (empty)** values

### ✅ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
```

### 💡 Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE bonus IS NULL;
```

🧠 **Explanation**:  
This finds rows where the `bonus` column has **no value** (null), meaning it was never filled in or doesn’t exist.

> ⚠ You **can’t use `= NULL`**, it won’t work. Use `IS NULL`.

---

## 🧠 Summary Table

|Clause|What It Does|Good For|
|---|---|---|
|`BETWEEN`|Filters a range (inclusive)|Numbers, dates|
|`IN`|Filters based on a list of values|Clean shortlists|
|`LIKE`|Simple pattern matching (wildcards)|Strings|
|`REGEXP`|Advanced pattern matching|Complex string patterns|
|`IS NULL`|Checks for empty/missing values|Data validation|

---


# 🚀Primary key & Foreign key
## 🔑 **PRIMARY KEY – In Depth**

A **Primary Key** is the **main identity** of a row in a table.

### 🧠 Think of it like:

Your **Aadhar number** – it uniquely identifies **you** in India. No one else can have your Aadhar number. That’s what a **primary key** does in a table.

---

### 🔍 Key Properties:

|Property|Description|
|---|---|
|✅ Unique|No two rows can have the same primary key.|
|❌ Not Null|Every row **must** have a value for the primary key.|
|❗ Only one|A table can have **only one** primary key.|
|🔒 Used in joins|It’s what other tables use to **refer** to this table.|

---

### 🧪 Example: Users Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

Here:

- `id` is the **primary key**
    
- It uniquely identifies each user
    
- It **cannot be NULL** or **duplicate**
    

|id|name|email|
|---|---|---|
|1|Achyuth|[achy@gmail.com](mailto:achy@gmail.com)|
|2|Yadav|[yadav@gmail.com](mailto:yadav@gmail.com)|

Try inserting another row with `id = 1`? **Error.** Try `id = NULL`? **Error.**

---

## 🔗 **FOREIGN KEY – In Depth**

A **Foreign Key** is how you link two tables together — it’s like saying:

> "This row in my table belongs to that row in that other table."

### 🧠 Real-life Analogy:

Your **loan record** has your Aadhar number in it — that's not **its** main identity, but it uses **your Aadhar** to say **you own that loan**.

That's a **foreign key**.

---

### 🔍 Key Properties:

|Property|Description|
|---|---|
|🧭 Points to a PK|A foreign key always points to a **primary key** in another table.|
|🔐 Enforces rules|It ensures that a record must reference an **existing** row in the other table.|
|🔄 Maintains integrity|Prevents "orphaned" data — like an order without a real user.|

---

### 🧪 Example: Orders Table

Let’s say we have a `users` table and an `orders` table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

Here:

- `order_id` is the primary key of `orders`
    
- `user_id` is a **foreign key**
    
- It refers to the `id` in the `users` table
    

This means:  
👉 You **can’t place an order** for a user that doesn't exist.

---

### 🔗 Visual Relationship

**users table** (parent):

|id (PK)|name|
|---|---|
|1|Achyuth|
|2|Yadav|

**orders table** (child):

|order_id|user_id (FK)|
|---|---|
|101|1|
|102|2|
|103|3 ❌ ← will throw an error if user 3 doesn't exist|

---

## 🧠 Summary:

|Feature|Primary Key|Foreign Key|
|---|---|---|
|Purpose|Uniquely identifies a record|Creates relationship between tables|
|Uniqueness|Must be unique|Can have duplicates|
|Null allowed?|❌ No|✅ Yes (unless restricted)|
|Can a table have many?|❌ Only one per table|✅ Can have multiple|
|Depends on?|Independent|Depends on the parent table|

---

## 🛠 Use Case Example:

Imagine you're building an eCommerce site.

- `users` → primary key: `id`
    
- `orders` → foreign key: `user_id` (which references `users.id`)
    

This way:

- You can find **all orders made by a specific user**
    
- You **can’t insert** an order for a **non-existing** user
    
- Your **data stays clean**
    

---

## 💣 Bonus Tip:

If a **foreign key reference is broken** (like deleting the user), you can set behavior using:

```sql
ON DELETE CASCADE
```

This will **automatically delete** all their orders if the user is deleted.

---



# 🚀`ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`
## 🔹 1. `ORDER BY` Clause — What is it?

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to **sort the result set** of a SQL query based on one or more columns.

### 🔸 Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC];
```

- `ASC` → Ascending order (default)
    
- `DESC` → Descending order
    

---

### 🔸 Example:

Let's say we have a table called `students`:

|id|name|marks|
|---|---|---|
|1|Rahul|85|
|2|Anjali|90|
|3|Karan|78|
|4|Sneha|92|
|5|Aman|85|

#### a) Sort by marks ascending:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY marks ASC;
```

**Output:**

|id|name|marks|
|---|---|---|
|3|Karan|78|
|1|Rahul|85|
|5|Aman|85|
|2|Anjali|90|
|4|Sneha|92|

#### b) Sort by marks descending, then name ascending (if marks are same):

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY marks DESC, name ASC;
```

**Output:**

|id|name|marks|
|---|---|---|
|4|Sneha|92|
|2|Anjali|90|
|1|Rahul|85|
|5|Aman|85|
|3|Karan|78|

---

## 🔹 2. `LIMIT` Clause — What is it?

The `LIMIT` clause is used to **restrict the number of rows** returned by the query.

### 🔸 Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
LIMIT [offset,] row_count;
```

- `row_count` → Number of rows to return
    
- `offset` (optional) → Number of rows to skip **before** starting to return rows
    

---

### 🔸 Example:

#### a) Get the top 3 students (by marks):

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY marks DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

**Output:**

|id|name|marks|
|---|---|---|
|4|Sneha|92|
|2|Anjali|90|
|1|Rahul|85|

#### b) Get 2 students starting from the 3rd rank (like pagination):

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY marks DESC
LIMIT 2 OFFSET 2;
```

**OR**

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY marks DESC
LIMIT 2, 2;
```

- Skips first 2 records
    
- Returns next 2
    

**Output:**

|id|name|marks|
|---|---|---|
|1|Rahul|85|
|5|Aman|85|

---

## 🧠 Real-World Use Case

In a leaderboard, you can combine `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to get:

```sql
-- Top 5 players by score
SELECT name, score
FROM leaderboard
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

---

## 📝 Summary

|Clause|Purpose|Example Use|
|---|---|---|
|`ORDER BY`|Sort the result set|`ORDER BY marks DESC`|
|`LIMIT`|Restrict number of rows output|`LIMIT 5` or `LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20`|

# 🚀INNER and OUTER JOINs 

## 🎯 What are JOINs?

JOINs are used to combine data from **two or more tables** based on a common column between them. Think of it like connecting puzzle pieces that share matching edges.

---

## 🔹 1. INNER JOIN - The "Perfect Match" Join

### What It Does:

INNER JOIN returns **only the rows that have matching values in BOTH tables**. If there's no match, the row gets excluded completely.

### ✅ Simple Definition:

> **INNER JOIN is used to join two (or more) tables and show only the rows where there is a matching value in both tables.**

**Real-life analogy:** Like a guest list for a party where only people who are invited AND confirmed attendance get a seat.

### Syntax:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

### 📝 Example 1: Students and Their Grades

**Table: students**

|student_id|name|class|
|---|---|---|
|1|Rahul|10A|
|2|Priya|10B|
|3|Arjun|10A|
|4|Meera|10C|

**Table: grades**

|student_id|subject|marks|
|---|---|---|
|1|Math|85|
|1|Science|92|
|2|Math|78|
|5|Math|88|

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT students.name, students.class, grades.subject, grades.marks
FROM students
INNER JOIN grades
ON students.student_id = grades.student_id;
```

**Result:**

|name|class|subject|marks|
|---|---|---|---|
|Rahul|10A|Math|85|
|Rahul|10A|Science|92|
|Priya|10B|Math|78|

**What happened?**

- Rahul (ID 1) and Priya (ID 2) had matching records in both tables ✅
- Arjun (ID 3) and Meera (ID 4) had no grades, so they're excluded ❌
- Student ID 5 in grades table had no matching student, so excluded ❌

---

## 🔹 2. OUTER JOINs - The "Include Everyone" Joins

OUTER JOINs include rows even when there's no perfect match. There are three types:

### 🔸 A) LEFT OUTER JOIN (LEFT JOIN)

**What It Does:** Returns **ALL rows from the LEFT table** + matching rows from the right table. Where there's no match, it fills with NULL.

**Real-life analogy:** Like a class attendance sheet where you list all students (left table) and mark their test scores (right table). Students who didn't take the test still appear on the list with blank scores.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT students.name, students.class, grades.subject, grades.marks
FROM students
LEFT JOIN grades
ON students.student_id = grades.student_id;
```

**Result:**

|name|class|subject|marks|
|---|---|---|---|
|Rahul|10A|Math|85|
|Rahul|10A|Science|92|
|Priya|10B|Math|78|
|Arjun|10A|NULL|NULL|
|Meera|10C|NULL|NULL|

**Key Point:** ALL students appear, even Arjun and Meera who have no grades.

### 🔸 B) RIGHT OUTER JOIN (RIGHT JOIN)

**What It Does:** Returns **ALL rows from the RIGHT table** + matching rows from the left table. Where there's no match, it fills with NULL.

**Real-life analogy:** Like showing all exam papers (right table) and trying to match them with student names (left table). Papers without matching students still show up.

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT students.name, students.class, grades.subject, grades.marks
FROM students
RIGHT JOIN grades
ON students.student_id = grades.student_id;
```

**Result:**

|name|class|subject|marks|
|---|---|---|---|
|Rahul|10A|Math|85|
|Rahul|10A|Science|92|
|Priya|10B|Math|78|
|NULL|NULL|Math|88|

**Key Point:** ALL grades appear, including the one for student ID 5 who doesn't exist in students table.

### 🔸 C) FULL OUTER JOIN (Simulated in MySQL)

**What It Does:** Returns **ALL rows from BOTH tables**, matching where possible and filling with NULL where no match exists.

**Note:** MySQL doesn't have direct FULL OUTER JOIN, but we can simulate it:

```sql
SELECT students.name, students.class, grades.subject, grades.marks
FROM students
LEFT JOIN grades ON students.student_id = grades.student_id

UNION

SELECT students.name, students.class, grades.subject, grades.marks
FROM students
RIGHT JOIN grades ON students.student_id = grades.student_id;
```

**Result:** Shows all students AND all grades, with NULLs where no matches exist.

## 📊 Visual Summary Table

|Join Type|Left Table Rows|Right Table Rows|Result|
|---|---|---|---|
|**INNER JOIN**|Only matched|Only matched|Intersection only|
|**LEFT JOIN**|ALL rows|Only matched|All left + matched right|
|**RIGHT JOIN**|Only matched|ALL rows|Matched left + all right|
|**FULL OUTER JOIN**|ALL rows|ALL rows|Everything from both|

## 🏢 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Database

**Table: customers**

|customer_id|name|email|
|---|---|---|
|1|John|john@email.com|
|2|Sarah|sarah@email.com|
|3|Michael|michael@email.com|

**Table: orders**

|order_id|customer_id|product|amount|
|---|---|---|---|
|101|1|Laptop|50000|
|102|1|Mouse|1500|
|103|2|Keyboard|3000|
|104|4|Monitor|15000|

#### Use Case 1: Find customers who have placed orders (INNER JOIN)

```sql
SELECT customers.name, orders.product, orders.amount
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```
#### ✅ Result Table:

|name|product|amount|
|---|---|---|
|John|Laptop|50000|
|John|Mouse|1500|
|Sarah|Keyboard|3000|

**When to use:** When you only want customers who have actually made purchases.

#### Use Case 2: List all customers and their orders (LEFT JOIN)

```sql
SELECT customers.name, orders.product, orders.amount
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

#### ✅ Final Result:

|name|product|amount|
|---|---|---|
|John|Laptop|50000|
|John|Mouse|1500|
|Sarah|Keyboard|3000|
|Michael|NULL|NULL|
**When to use:** When you want to see all customers, including those who haven't ordered anything yet (for marketing purposes).

### Example 2: Employee and Department Database

**Table: employees**

|emp_id|name|salary|
|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|50000|
|2|Bob|60000|
|3|Charlie|55000|

**Table: departments**

|emp_id|dept_name|location|
|---|---|---|
|1|IT|Mumbai|
|2|HR|Delhi|
|4|Finance|Pune|

#### Find employees with their department info (INNER JOIN)

```sql
SELECT employees.name, employees.salary, departments.dept_name, departments.location
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments
ON employees.emp_id = departments.emp_id;
```

#### ✅ Final Result Table:

|name|salary|dept_name|location|
|---|---|---|---|
|Alice|50000|IT|Mumbai|
|Bob|60000|HR|Delhi|
**Result:** Only Alice and Bob (who have department assignments).

#### List all employees and their departments (LEFT JOIN)

```sql
SELECT employees.name, employees.salary, departments.dept_name, departments.location
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments
ON employees.emp_id = departments.emp_id;
```
#### ✅ Final Result

| name    | salary | dept_name | location |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | -------- |
| Alice   | 50000  | IT        | Mumbai   |
| Bob     | 60000  | HR        | Delhi    |
| Charlie | 55000  | NULL      | NULL     |
**Result:** All employees including Charlie (who shows with NULL department).

## 🎯 When to Use Each Join

### Use INNER JOIN when:

- You need only records that exist in both tables
- Finding customers who have made purchases
- Getting students who have submitted assignments
- Matching products with their categories

### Use LEFT JOIN when:

- You want all records from the main table
- Showing all customers (even those without orders)
- Listing all students (even those without grades)
- Reporting all products (even those not sold)

### Use RIGHT JOIN when:

- You want all records from the secondary table
- Less commonly used than LEFT JOIN
- Usually LEFT JOIN is preferred for readability

### Use FULL OUTER JOIN when:

- You need complete data from both tables
- Comparing two datasets to find matches and differences
- Data analysis and reporting scenarios

---

## ⚡ Performance Tips

1. **Index your join columns** for faster queries
2. **INNER JOINs are typically faster** than OUTER JOINs
3. **Put the larger table on the left** in LEFT JOINs
4. **Use WHERE clauses** to filter data early
5. **Avoid joining on functions** - join on plain columns when possible

---

## 🔧 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting the ON clause** - Always specify the join condition
2. **Using wrong join type** - INNER when you need LEFT, etc.
3. **Not handling NULLs** - Remember OUTER JOINs can produce NULLs
4. **Cartesian products** - Joining without proper conditions
5. **Performance issues** - Not indexing join columns

---

## 🚀 Practice Exercises

Try these queries with sample data:

1. Find all orders with customer details (INNER JOIN)
2. List all products and their sales (even products with no sales) (LEFT JOIN)
3. Show all reviews and reviewer details (RIGHT JOIN)
4. Create a complete report of students and their grades (FULL OUTER JOIN simulation)

Remember: The key to mastering JOINs is practice with real datasets. Start simple and gradually work with more complex scenarios!


# 🚀Sample code explanation of Inner join


### 🧾 SQL Code:

```sql
SELECT o.order_id, p.name, o.quantity, o.unit_price, o.unit_price - p.unit_price AS Discount
FROM order_items o
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
ORDER BY o.order_id;
```

---

## 🧠 What is this query doing?

This query is showing:

- **details of ordered items**
    
- along with **product names**
    
- and also **calculating how much discount** was applied (if any)
    
- and finally **sorting** the results by order ID.
    

---

## 🧱 Let's break it down piece by piece:

### 🔸 `FROM order_items o`

- This tells MySQL:
    
    > "Start with the `order_items` table."
    
- We're calling it `o` (short form / alias).
    

So instead of writing `order_items.order_id`, we’ll just say `o.order_id`.

---

### 🔸 `JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id`

- This line **joins** another table called `products` (aliased as `p`) using the **common column** `product_id`.
    
- So for every item in `order_items`, we’re getting the matching product from `products`.
    

✅ Think of it like combining both tables wherever `product_id` matches.

---

### 🔸 `SELECT o.order_id, p.name, o.quantity, o.unit_price`

- This part is **choosing which columns** to show in the output:
    
    - `o.order_id`: The ID of the order
        
    - `p.name`: The name of the product from the `products` table
        
    - `o.quantity`: How many units were ordered
        
    - `o.unit_price`: Price charged per unit during the order
        

---

### 🔸 `o.unit_price - p.unit_price AS Discount`

- This is a **calculated column**.
    
- It subtracts:
    
    - `p.unit_price` (original product price)
        
    - from `o.unit_price` (price charged in the order)
        
- The result is labeled as `Discount`.
    

✅ If the result is:

- **Positive** → maybe a price markup
    
- **Negative** → a discount
    
- **Zero** → no change
    

---

### 🔸 `ORDER BY o.order_id`

- This sorts the final results by `order_id` in **ascending order**.
    

---

## 📊 What the output might look like:

|order_id|name|quantity|unit_price|Discount|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|101|Laptop|1|50000|-5000|
|102|Mouse|2|1200|0|
|103|Headphones|1|2500|500|

---

## 📝 Summary (Super Simple):

- You're combining two tables: `order_items` and `products`
    
- Showing order details + product name
    
- Calculating discount based on original vs order price
    
- And sorting the result by order ID
    

---

# 🚀Joining across different databases 


## 🧠 Can We JOIN Tables from Different Databases?

✅ Yes! In MySQL, you **can join tables from different databases** as long as:

- You have access to both databases
    
- They are on the **same MySQL server**
    

---

## 🔧 Syntax to Join Across Databases:

```sql
SELECT a.column1, b.column2
FROM database1.table1 AS a
INNER JOIN database2.table2 AS b
ON a.common_column = b.common_column;
```

> Just **prefix the table names** with their database names!

---

### 📦 Real-Life Example:

Suppose:

- Database `sales_db` has a table `orders`
    
- Database `inventory_db` has a table `products`
    

### Query:

```sql
SELECT 
  orders.order_id, 
  products.name, 
  orders.quantity
FROM sales_db.orders AS orders
INNER JOIN inventory_db.products AS products
  ON orders.product_id = products.product_id;
```

---

### ✅ What This Does:

- Joins `orders` table from `sales_db`
    
- With `products` table from `inventory_db`
    
- Based on matching `product_id`
    
- Shows order ID, product name, and quantity
    

---

### ⚠️ Notes:

- You **must have permission** to access both databases.
    
- You can also do `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, etc., the same way.
    
- Works **only** if both databases are on the same MySQL server.
    

---

### 💬 Tip (Optional if asked in interview):

> “In MySQL, we can join tables across different databases by prefixing table names with their database name. This is useful in systems with modular database structures — like one DB for users, one for products, etc.”

---


# 🚀Self Joining tables


## ✅ What is a SELF JOIN in MySQL?

> A **Self Join** is when a table is **joined with itself**.

- It's useful when the rows in a table are **related to other rows in the same table**.
    
- We use **aliases** to treat the same table as if it's two separate ones.
    

---

### 📦 Real-Life Example:

Imagine a table called `employees`:

|emp_id|name|manager_id|
|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|NULL|
|2|Bob|1|
|3|Charlie|1|
|4|David|2|

Here:

- `manager_id` is referencing another `emp_id` in the **same table**.
    

So:

- Alice is the top manager
    
- Bob and Charlie report to Alice
    
- David reports to Bob
    

---

### 🔧 Use Self Join to Find:

> “Which employee reports to which manager?”

```sql
SELECT 
  e.name AS Employee,
  m.name AS Manager
FROM 
  employees e
JOIN 
  employees m 
ON 
  e.manager_id = m.emp_id;
```

---

### ✅ Output:

|Employee|Manager|
|---|---|
|Bob|Alice|
|Charlie|Alice|
|David|Bob|

---

### 🧠 Summary:

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|Self Join|Joining a table to **itself**|
|Use case|Hierarchies, like manager-employee|
|Needs alias?|✅ Yes, to treat as two copies|
|Common fields|A column that references the same table (e.g., `manager_id`)|

---

# 🚀Join multiple Tables 


## 🛠️ Example: Joining 3 Tables

Let’s say we have the following tables:

- `orders` (order_id, customer_id, order_date)
    
- `customers` (customer_id, name)
    
- `products` (product_id, name, price)
    
- `order_items` (order_id, product_id, quantity)
    

---

### 🔗 Join `orders`, `customers`, and `order_items` + `products`

```sql
SELECT 
  o.order_id,
  c.name AS customer_name,
  p.name AS product_name,
  oi.quantity,
  p.price,
  (oi.quantity * p.price) AS total_price
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id;
```

---

## 💡 Tips:

- **Use table aliases** (`o`, `c`, `oi`, `p`) to keep queries readable.
    
- **Add `WHERE` or `ORDER BY`** as needed to filter/sort data.
    
- You can **join as many tables** as needed, just be careful about performance.
    

---

# 🚀What is a **Compound Join Condition** ?

A **compound join condition** is when **multiple conditions** are used together in a `JOIN` clause using logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, etc. These conditions define how rows from different tables should be matched.

---

### 🧠 Why Use a Compound Join Condition?

In real-world databases, **a single column might not be enough** to establish the relationship between rows of two tables. A **compound join** ensures:

- More **precise matching** between rows.
    
- **Avoids incorrect or duplicate data** due to ambiguous or partial matches.
    
- Supports **composite keys** (when two or more columns together make a unique key).
    

---

### ⚙️ Basic Syntax:

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM table1 t1
JOIN table2 t2
ON t1.col1 = t2.col1 AND t1.col2 = t2.col2;
```

---

### 📌 Real-World Example:

#### Tables:

**1. `class_registrations`**

|student_id|course_code|semester|
|---|---|---|
|101|CS101|2024S1|
|102|CS101|2024S1|

**2. `course_grades`**

|student_id|course_code|semester|grade|
|---|---|---|---|
|101|CS101|2024S1|A|
|102|CS101|2024S2|B|

---

### ✅ Without compound condition (WRONG):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM class_registrations cr
JOIN course_grades cg
ON cr.student_id = cg.student_id;
```

🛑 **Problem**: It joins rows just based on `student_id`, so student 102’s **wrong semester** grade gets pulled.

---

### ✅ With compound condition (CORRECT):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM class_registrations cr
JOIN course_grades cg
ON cr.student_id = cg.student_id
AND cr.course_code = cg.course_code
AND cr.semester = cg.semester;
```

✅ **Now** it matches both `student_id`, `course_code`, and `semester` — **fully accurate**.

---

### 🔄 When to Use:

- Tables have **composite primary/foreign keys** (more than one column used to uniquely identify a row).
    
- You want to match rows **only when multiple conditions are true**.
    
- Data could otherwise be **incorrectly joined** or **repeated**.
    

---

### 🧯 Summary:

|🔍 Feature|✅ Compound Join Condition|
|---|---|
|Accuracy in matching|✅ Improved|
|Handles composite keys|✅ Yes|
|Reduces incorrect joins|✅ Definitely|
|Syntax complexity|⚠️ Slightly more|


# 🚀What is an **Implicit Join** ?

An **implicit join** is when you **join two or more tables without using the `JOIN` keyword**, and instead, you **list the tables in the `FROM` clause separated by commas**, and use the `WHERE` clause to specify how they are related.

---

### 🧱 Syntax of Implicit Join:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1, table2
WHERE table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

---

### 🧠 Why is it called "implicit"?

Because the **join relationship is not explicitly written** using `JOIN ... ON` — it’s **implied** through the `WHERE` clause.

---

### ✅ Example:

Assume you have two tables:

**`employees`**

|emp_id|name|dept_id|
|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|10|
|2|Bob|20|

**`departments`**

|dept_id|dept_name|
|---|---|
|10|HR|
|20|Engineering|

---

### 🔗 Implicit Join:

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees, departments
WHERE employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id;
```

---

### 🔗 Equivalent Explicit Join (Preferred):

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id;
```

---

### ⚖️ Implicit vs Explicit JOIN

|Feature|Implicit JOIN|Explicit JOIN|
|---|---|---|
|Style|Old-school|Modern SQL|
|Readability|❌ Less readable in complex queries|✅ Easier to read and manage|
|Supports OUTER JOINs|❌ No|✅ Yes (LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER)|
|Performance|🚫 Same under the hood|✅ Same under the hood|

---

### 🚨 Best Practice:

Avoid implicit joins in modern SQL writing. Use **explicit joins** for:

- Better readability
    
- Support for different join types (LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER)
    
- Reduced chance of logic errors
    

---

# 🚀What is an **OUTER JOIN**?

An **OUTER JOIN** returns **matching rows** from two tables **plus the non-matching rows** from one or both tables.

There are **two types** in MySQL:

|Type of Outer Join|Description|
|---|---|
|`LEFT OUTER JOIN` (or just `LEFT JOIN`)|Returns all rows from the **left** table, even if there's no match in the right.|
|`RIGHT OUTER JOIN` (or just `RIGHT JOIN`)|Returns all rows from the **right** table, even if there's no match in the left.|

> ❗ MySQL **does not support FULL OUTER JOIN** directly, but we can simulate it using `UNION`.

---

## 🔧 2. Why Use OUTER JOIN?

- To find **missing relationships** (e.g., customers who placed no orders).
    
- To show **all records** from one table regardless of whether matches exist.
    
- To create **comprehensive reports** that include all items, even if data is incomplete.
    

---

## 🧪 3. Examples

### Tables:

**Table: `customers`**

|customer_id|name|
|---|---|
|1|Alice|
|2|Bob|
|3|Charlie|

**Table: `orders`**

|order_id|customer_id|amount|
|---|---|---|
|101|1|500|
|102|2|300|

---

### ✅ A. LEFT OUTER JOIN

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

🔍 **What this does:**

- Fetches **all customers**.
    
- Shows their orders if they have any.
    
- If they don’t have orders, `order_id` and `amount` will be `NULL`.
    

✅ **Output:**

|customer_id|name|order_id|amount|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|101|500|
|2|Bob|102|300|
|3|Charlie|NULL|NULL|

---

### ✅ B. RIGHT OUTER JOIN

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM customers c
RIGHT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

🔍 **What this does:**

- Fetches **all orders**.
    
- Shows customer info if available.
    
- If no matching customer exists, `name` will be `NULL`.
    

---

### ✅ C. Simulate FULL OUTER JOIN in MySQL (Not supported directly)

```sql
-- LEFT JOIN part
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id

UNION

-- RIGHT JOIN part
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM customers c
RIGHT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

This returns:

- All customers with or without orders.
    
- All orders with or without matching customers.
    

---

## 🔁 Summary Table:

|JOIN Type|Returns What?|
|---|---|
|INNER JOIN|Only matching rows from both tables|
|LEFT OUTER JOIN|All rows from left + matched from right|
|RIGHT OUTER JOIN|All rows from right + matched from left|
|FULL OUTER JOIN|All rows from both sides, with NULLs for missing matches (needs `UNION` in MySQL)|

---

## 🚦When to Use?

- `LEFT JOIN`: When your **primary table is on the left** and you want **all its data**.
    
- `RIGHT JOIN`: When your **main focus is the right-side table**.
    
- `FULL OUTER JOIN` (via UNION): When you want **everything** from both tables.
    

---


# 🚀What is a Multi-Table OUTER JOIN?

When you perform **OUTER JOINs across more than two tables**, you're combining records from all of them — making sure **non-matching rows from one or more tables are still included** using `LEFT JOIN` or `RIGHT JOIN`.

---

### 📦 Example Use Case

Let’s say you have **3 tables**:

#### `customers`

|customer_id|name|
|---|---|
|1|Alice|
|2|Bob|
|3|Charlie|

#### `orders`

|order_id|customer_id|product_id|
|---|---|---|
|101|1|201|
|102|2|202|

#### `products`

|product_id|product_name|

### 🧠 Goal:

Show **all customers**, their **orders if any**, and the **product name** if ordered — even if a customer has **no orders** or the order has **no product info**.

---

### ✅ LEFT JOIN across 3 tables:

```sql
SELECT 
  c.name AS customer_name,
  o.order_id,
  p.product_name
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
LEFT JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id;
```

---

### 🔍 What’s happening here?

- First `LEFT JOIN`: keeps all **customers**, even if they have **no orders**.
    
- Second `LEFT JOIN`: keeps all **orders**, even if they have **no matching product** (e.g. broken product_id).
    

---

### 🧾 Sample Output:

|customer_name|order_id|product_name|
|---|---|---|
|Alice|101|Laptop|
|Bob|102|Phone|
|Charlie|NULL|NULL|

---

### 🔁 RIGHT JOIN variation:

If you want to **focus on products**, showing all products even if they’re **not ordered**, you could:

```sql
SELECT 
  p.product_name,
  o.order_id,
  c.name AS customer_name
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN orders o ON p.product_id = o.product_id
LEFT JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

This ensures:

- All **products** are shown.
    
- Orders are shown **only if they exist**.
    
- Customer info is filled only if they placed an order.
    

---

## ✅ Tips for Joining Multiple Tables with OUTER JOINs

|Tip|Why It Matters|
|---|---|
|Use `LEFT JOIN` in the order of importance|Start from the table you want **all rows from**|
|Use table aliases (`c`, `o`, `p`)|Keeps your query clean|
|Be careful with `NULL`s|OUTER JOINs often return `NULL` for unmatched rows|
|Add `WHERE` conditions after joins|Filters should come **after joins**, not in `ON` if you're doing OUTER JOINs|

---

### 🔨 Real-Life Uses:

- Showing **users and their activity**, even if they have none.
    
- Showing **products and sales**, even if unsold.
    
- Displaying **project assignments**, including unassigned projects.

# 🚀What is a **Self JOIN**?

A **Self JOIN** is when a table is joined **to itself**.

You use it when rows in a table are **related to other rows in the same table** — for example, **employees and their managers**, or **categories and subcategories**.

---

## 🤔 Then, What is a **Self OUTER JOIN**?

A **Self OUTER JOIN** is a **LEFT (or RIGHT) JOIN where a table joins to itself**, and you also include **non-matching rows** using `LEFT JOIN` or `RIGHT JOIN`.

> ✅ This means: you want to include rows that **don’t have a matching "self" relationship**.

---

### 🧾 Example: Employee & Manager Table

#### Table: `employees`

|emp_id|name|manager_id|
|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|NULL|
|2|Bob|1|
|3|Charlie|1|
|4|David|99|
|5|Eve|NULL|

---

### ✅ Self **LEFT OUTER JOIN** to get employees and their managers (even if manager doesn’t exist):

```sql
SELECT 
  e.name AS employee_name,
  m.name AS manager_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id;
```

### 🧾 Output:

|employee_name|manager_name|
|---|---|
|Alice|NULL|
|Bob|Alice|
|Charlie|Alice|
|David|NULL|
|Eve|NULL|

---

## 🔍 Why Use Self OUTER JOIN?

|Use Case|Example|
|---|---|
|Employees and their managers|Get all employees, even if they don’t have a manager|
|Categories and parent categories|Show all categories, even if they have no parent|
|Comments and reply-to|Show all comments, even if they’re not replies|

---

## ⚠️ Things to Remember:

- Always **alias** the table (`e`, `m`) to avoid confusion.
    
- Use `LEFT JOIN` if you want **all child rows**, including those without a match.
    
- `NULL`s in the result indicate **no relationship** found.
    

---

### 🔄 Summary

|Concept|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Self JOIN|Joining a table to itself|
|Self OUTER JOIN|Joining a table to itself, including non-matching rows (using `LEFT JOIN`)|

# 🚀What is the `USING` clause ?

The `USING` clause is used in `JOIN` operations when **joining two tables on one or more columns with the **same name**.

### ✅ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
JOIN table2
USING (column_name);
```

It’s a **shorter version** of:

```sql
... ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
```

---

## ✅ When to Use `USING`

- The **column name is the same** in both tables.
    
- You want to avoid writing `table1.column = table2.column`.
    
- You don’t need to reference the column with table aliases.
    

---

### 🔄 Example:

Let’s say you have these tables:

#### `employees`

|emp_id|name|dept_id|
|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|10|
|2|Bob|20|

#### `departments`

|dept_id|dept_name|
|---|---|
|10|HR|
|20|Engineering|

---

### 💡 Join with `ON`:

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d
ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

---

### ✨ Same thing with `USING`:

```sql
SELECT name, dept_name
FROM employees
JOIN departments
USING (dept_id);
```

🚀 **Cleaner and shorter!**

---

### ⚠️ Things to Know About `USING`

|Feature|Details|
|---|---|
|Aliasing|The column used in `USING` appears **only once** in the result|
|Multiple columns|You can join on more than one: `USING (col1, col2)`|
|No need to prefix|You can refer to the column without `table.column` format|
|Column must exist in both tables|Otherwise, you'll get an error|

---

### ❌ Invalid Example:

If the column name is **not the same** in both tables:

```sql
-- This will throw an error if column names differ
SELECT * 
FROM orders
JOIN customers 
USING (customer_id); -- Works only if both have 'customer_id'
```

---

### ✅ Best Practice:

Use `USING` **only** when:

- Column names are identical.
    
- You want a simpler and more readable query.
    

---





# 🚀Natural Join and Cross Join
## 🌿 1. NATURAL JOIN

### 🔍 Definition:

A `NATURAL JOIN` automatically joins **two tables** by matching **all columns with the same names** and **compatible data types** — no need to write `ON` or `USING`.

---

### ✅ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
NATURAL JOIN table2;
```

---

### 💡 How it works:

MySQL checks for **same-named columns** in both tables and automatically joins on them.

---

### 🧪 Example:

#### `students`

|student_id|name|
|---|---|
|1|Alice|
|2|Bob|

#### `marks`

|student_id|subject|score|
|---|---|---|
|1|Math|90|
|2|Science|80|

```sql
SELECT *
FROM students
NATURAL JOIN marks;
```

### ✅ Output:

|student_id|name|subject|score|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|Math|90|
|2|Bob|Science|80|

---

### ⚠️ Be careful:

- If **column names don’t match**, the join **won’t happen**, and results might be wrong.
    
- Use **`JOIN ... USING`** or `JOIN ... ON` if you want **full control**.
    

---

## 🔁 2. CROSS JOIN (aka Cartesian Join)

### 🔍 Definition:

A `CROSS JOIN` returns **every possible combination** of rows from two tables.

---

### ✅ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

OR (implicitly):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1, table2;
```

---

### 💡 How it works:

If `table1` has `n` rows and `table2` has `m` rows, the result will have `n × m` rows.

---

### 🧪 Example:

#### `colors`

|color|
|---|
|Red|
|Blue|

#### `sizes`

|size|
|---|
|S|
|M|

```sql
SELECT *
FROM colors
CROSS JOIN sizes;
```

### ✅ Output:

|color|size|
|---|---|
|Red|S|
|Red|M|
|Blue|S|
|Blue|M|

---

### ⚠️ Be careful:

- It **grows fast** with large tables (can create thousands of rows).
    
- Usually used in **product combinations**, **calendar tables**, **testing**, or **generating permutations**.
    

---

## 🧠 Summary Table:

|Join Type|Behavior|
|---|---|
|**NATURAL JOIN**|Auto joins on **same-named** columns|
|**CROSS JOIN**|Joins **every row with every row** (Cartesian product)|

---

## 🧰 When to Use

|Use Case|Join Type|
|---|---|
|Same-named foreign keys|`NATURAL JOIN` (if you're lazy 😅)|
|All combinations (e.g., colors × sizes)|`CROSS JOIN`|
|Precision and control|Use `JOIN ... ON` or `USING` instead of `NATURAL`|

---


# 🚀What is the `UNION` operator ?

The `UNION` operator combines the **result sets of two or more `SELECT` queries** into a **single result set**, removing duplicates **by default**.

---

### ✅ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1

UNION

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

---

## 📌 Key Rules:

1. Each `SELECT` must have the **same number of columns**.
    
2. Columns must be in the **same order and similar data types**.
    
3. By default, `UNION` **removes duplicates**. Use `UNION ALL` to keep them.
    

---

## 🧠 Difference: `UNION` vs `UNION ALL`

|Feature|`UNION`|`UNION ALL`|
|---|---|---|
|Removes duplicates|✅ Yes|❌ No|
|Faster performance|❌ Slower|✅ Faster|
|Use case|Clean result sets|Preserve duplicates (e.g., logs)|

---

## 🧪 Example:

### 🎯 Tables:

#### `students_2023`

|id|name|
|---|---|
|1|Alice|
|2|Bob|

#### `students_2024`

|id|name|
|---|---|
|2|Bob|
|3|Charlie|

---

### ✅ Query:

```sql
SELECT name FROM students_2023
UNION
SELECT name FROM students_2024;
```

### 🔄 Output:

|name|
|---|
|Alice|
|Bob|
|Charlie|

➡️ Notice: **Bob appeared only once** because `UNION` removes duplicates.

---

### 🔁 With `UNION ALL`:

```sql
SELECT name FROM students_2023
UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM students_2024;
```

### 📦 Output:

|name|
|---|
|Alice|
|Bob|
|Bob|
|Charlie|

---

## 🛠️ Real-Life Use Cases:

|Use Case|Example|
|---|---|
|Merging data from different time ranges|Combining `sales_2023` and `sales_2024`|
|Displaying records from archived & active tables|`archived_users` + `users`|
|Searching across multiple tables|Search both `products` and `services` tables for a keyword|
|Simulating FULL OUTER JOIN|`LEFT JOIN` + `RIGHT JOIN` via `UNION`|

---

### 🔧 FULL OUTER JOIN Simulation:

```sql
SELECT * FROM A
LEFT JOIN B ON A.id = B.id

UNION

SELECT * FROM A
RIGHT JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;
```

➡️ Since MySQL doesn’t support `FULL OUTER JOIN`, `UNION` helps us simulate it.

---

## ✅ Summary:

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|Combines data|Yes, from multiple SELECTs|
|Duplicates|Removed by default (`UNION`), preserved with `UNION ALL`|
|Conditions|Same number of columns, compatible data types|
|Use cases|Merging tables, simulating full outer joins, unified reports|

---

# 🚀What is a **Column Attribute**?

In MySQL, a **column attribute** defines specific **behavior or constraints** for a **column** in a table — things like whether it can be null, how it auto-increments, or whether it has a default value.

---

## 📋 Common Column Attributes

|Attribute|Description|
|---|---|
|`NOT NULL`|Prevents `NULL` values. The column **must have** a value.|
|`DEFAULT`|Sets a **default value** if none is provided during `INSERT`.|
|`AUTO_INCREMENT`|Automatically increases the value for each new row (used for primary keys).|
|`UNSIGNED`|Only allows **positive numbers** (for numeric types).|
|`ZEROFILL`|Pads the number with **leading zeros** (e.g., 0012 instead of 12).|
|`UNIQUE`|Ensures all values in the column are **unique**.|
|`PRIMARY KEY`|Marks the column as the **main identifier** for table rows.|
|`COMMENT`|Adds a text comment to describe the column.|

---

## 📌 Example Table with Attributes

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    age INT UNSIGNED DEFAULT 18,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### What’s happening here?

- `id`: auto-incremented primary key (unique for each user).
    
- `username`: must be provided, and must be unique.
    
- `email`: cannot be null.
    
- `age`: positive integer only, default is 18 if not provided.
    
- `created_at`: sets the current time automatically if not specified.
    

---

## ✅ Why Use Column Attributes?

- ✅ **Data integrity**: Prevents bad data (e.g. `NULL` where it's not allowed).
    
- ✅ **Automation**: Things like `AUTO_INCREMENT` and `DEFAULT` reduce manual work.
    
- ✅ **Validation**: MySQL checks constraints like `UNIQUE` for you.
    
- ✅ **Performance**: Indexing and primary key constraints can make queries faster.
    

---

# 🚀Inserting Values into table
## ✅ 1. **Insert a Single Row**

### 🔹 Syntax:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

### 🔹 Example:

Let's say you have a table `students`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
);
```

Insert **one student**:

```sql
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age)
VALUES (1, 'Achyuth', 22);
```

---

## ✅ 2. **Insert Multiple Rows**

### 🔹 Syntax:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES 
(value1a, value2a, value3a),
(value1b, value2b, value3b),
(value1c, value2c, value3c);
```

### 🔹 Example:

Insert **three students at once**:

```sql
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age)
VALUES 
(2, 'Mahindra', 21),
(3, 'Yadav', 23),
(4, 'Adithyan', 22);
```

This is faster and more efficient than inserting one row at a time.

---

## ⚠️ Notes:

- The column order in `INSERT INTO` must match the values in `VALUES(...)`.
    
- You can **skip columns** if they have `DEFAULT` values or are `AUTO_INCREMENT`.
    
- MySQL will throw an error if:
    
    - You violate constraints (like `PRIMARY KEY`, `NOT NULL`)
        
    - You insert the wrong data type
        

---

## ✅ Bonus: Insert Without Column Names

Only if you're inserting **values for all columns in order**:

```sql
INSERT INTO students
VALUES (5, 'Ravi', 20);
```

But this is **not recommended** — always better to specify column names for clarity and safety.

---

# 🚀Inserting Hierarchical Rows 

When we say **“hierarchical rows”**, we usually mean rows that have **parent-child relationships** — like:

- Employees reporting to managers
    
- Comments replying to other comments
    
- Categories having subcategories
    

---

## ✅ 1. **Use a Self-Referencing Foreign Key**

Let’s take an example: a table of employees where each employee may report to another employee.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    manager_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employees(id)
);
```

- `manager_id` points to another `id` in the **same table**
    
- This creates a **hierarchical** structure (e.g., CEO → Manager → Employee)
    

---

## ✅ 2. **Insert Hierarchical Rows in the Right Order**

You must insert the **parent row first**, then the child rows that reference it.

### 🔹 Step-by-step Example:

#### 👉 Insert CEO (top of the hierarchy)

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (name, manager_id)
VALUES ('Ravi (CEO)', NULL);
```

Let’s say this CEO got assigned `id = 1`.

#### 👉 Insert Manager under CEO

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (name, manager_id)
VALUES ('Achyuth (Manager)', 1);
```

#### 👉 Insert Developer under Manager

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (name, manager_id)
VALUES ('Yadav (Developer)', 2);
```

#### 👉 Insert Intern under Developer

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (name, manager_id)
VALUES ('Mahindra (Intern)', 3);
```

This creates the following hierarchy:

```
Ravi (CEO)
└── Achyuth (Manager)
    └── Yadav (Developer)
        └── Mahindra (Intern)
```

---

## 📌 How to View the Hierarchy?

Using a basic self join:

```sql
SELECT e.name AS Employee, m.name AS Manager
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.id;
```

You can also use **recursive queries (CTEs)** in MySQL 8.0+ to go deep into the hierarchy.

---

## 🔧 Use Cases of Hierarchical Inserts:

- 📁 Folder & Subfolder structure
    
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family trees
    
- 🧑‍🏫 Teacher-student chains
    
- 🛍️ Categories & subcategories in eCommerce
    

---

# 🚀Creating a copy of a Table 
## 🧱 1. **Copy Only Table Structure (No Data)**

This creates a new table with the **same columns, data types, and indexes**, but **without any rows**.

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table LIKE original_table;
```

✅ _Use this when you want to keep the schema but insert different data._

---

## 📋 2. **Copy Structure + Data**

This copies both the **schema and all rows**.

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT * FROM original_table;
```

⚠️ **Note**: This method will **not copy indexes, foreign keys, constraints, or AUTO_INCREMENT** settings. Just the data and columns.

---

## 💾 3. **Copy Only Some Columns or Filtered Data**

You can copy a **subset of columns or filtered rows** like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT column1, column2
FROM original_table
WHERE some_condition;
```

🔍 _Example:_

```sql
CREATE TABLE high_value_orders AS
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE total_price > 5000;
```

---

## 🔄 4. **Duplicate Data into an Existing Table**

If the target table already exists and has the same structure:

```sql
INSERT INTO new_table
SELECT * FROM original_table;
```

You can also specify columns if needed:

```sql
INSERT INTO new_table (id, name)
SELECT id, name FROM original_table;
```

---

## 🛠️ 5. **Copy Table With Indexes and Constraints (Full Clone)**

MySQL doesn’t have a direct one-liner to copy **everything** (structure + data + keys), but you can do it like this:

```sql
-- Step 1: Dump original table structure and data
mysqldump -u root -p your_db original_table > backup.sql

-- Step 2: Rename in SQL or edit `backup.sql` to create new_table
-- Step 3: Run backup.sql
```

Or inside MySQL Workbench, right-click > "Copy to Clipboard" > "Create Statement".

---

### 🧪 Example:

```sql
-- Original table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO employees (name, department)
VALUES ('Alice', 'HR'), ('Bob', 'IT');

-- Copy structure + data
CREATE TABLE employees_copy AS
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

---

# 🚀Updating single and multiple rows 
## ✅ **1. Updating a Single Row**

Use a `WHERE` clause that matches **only one record**, typically using a primary key like `id`.

### 📌 Syntax:

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition;
```

### 🔍 Example:

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 60000
WHERE employee_id = 101;
```

➡️ This will update the `salary` column of the employee with `employee_id = 101`.

---

## ✅ **2. Updating Multiple Rows**

Use a `WHERE` clause that matches **more than one record**.

### 🔍 Example:

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET department = 'HR'
WHERE department = 'Human Resources';
```

➡️ This updates **all rows** where the department is `Human Resources`, changing it to `HR`.

---

## ✅ **3. Updating Different Values for Different Rows**

If you want to update multiple rows with **different values**, you can use the `CASE` expression.

### 🔍 Example:

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = CASE 
    WHEN department = 'Sales' THEN 55000
    WHEN department = 'IT' THEN 65000
    ELSE salary
END;
```

➡️ This sets different salaries based on the department, while keeping the rest unchanged.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

- Always **back up your data** or run a `SELECT` first with the same `WHERE` clause to check which rows will be affected.
    
- If you **forget the `WHERE` clause**, MySQL will update **all rows** in the table 😨.
    

---

## ✍️ Pro Tip for Safe Updating

Before running:

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 50000;
```

Do a quick:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

or:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary <> 50000;
```

---




# 🚀What is a Subquery in UPDATE?

A **subquery** is a query nested inside another SQL statement. In an `UPDATE`, you can use it to:

- Set a column's value based on another table
    
- Filter which rows to update
    

---

## ✅ Syntax:

```sql
UPDATE table1
SET column1 = (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE condition)
WHERE some_condition;
```

---

## 🔍 Example 1: Update Based on Another Table

Let’s say you have:

- `invoices(invoice_id, client_id, payment_total)`
    
- `clients(client_id, default_payment_amount)`
    

You want to update the `payment_total` in `invoices` based on the client's default value:

```sql
UPDATE invoices
SET payment_total = (
    SELECT default_payment_amount 
    FROM clients 
    WHERE clients.client_id = invoices.client_id
)
WHERE invoice_id = 1;
```

✅ This sets `payment_total` to the corresponding client's default amount **only for invoice_id = 1**.

---

## 🔍 Example 2: Update Using Aggregated Subquery

Suppose you want to set `payment_total` of each invoice to the **average payment_total**:

```sql
UPDATE invoices
SET payment_total = (
    SELECT AVG(payment_total) 
    FROM invoices
);
```

⚠️ This will **update all rows** with the **same value** (the average).

---

## 🔍 Example 3: Update Based on MAX Value from Another Table

```sql
UPDATE invoices
SET payment_total = (
    SELECT MAX(payment_total) FROM invoices
)
WHERE invoice_id = 5;
```

➡️ This sets `payment_total` of invoice 5 to the highest payment in the table.

---

## ⚠️ Notes:

- Subqueries must return **only one value** (scalar) unless you're using `IN` or `EXISTS`.
    
- If it might return multiple rows, use `LIMIT 1` or make sure your `WHERE` clause is specific enough.
    

---

# 🚀Deleting single or multiple rows in a table
## ✅ **Basic Syntax**

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### ⚠️ Important:

- **Without `WHERE`**, it deletes **all rows** in the table.
    
- MySQL **won’t ask for confirmation**, so always double-check your `WHERE` clause.
    

---

## 🔹 **Examples**

### 1. **Delete a Single Row**

```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 101;
```

Deletes the employee with ID 101.

---

### 2. **Delete Multiple Rows**

```sql
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE order_date < '2024-01-01';
```

Deletes all orders placed before Jan 1, 2024.

---

### 3. **Delete All Rows from a Table**

```sql
DELETE FROM products;
```

Deletes all rows from `products` table (but keeps the table structure).

> 🔁 Alternative:
> 
> ```sql
> TRUNCATE TABLE products;
> ```
> 
> - Faster, but can't be rolled back (depending on engine).
>     
> - Resets auto-increment value too.
>     

---

### 4. **Delete with JOIN**

```sql
DELETE o
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE c.status = 'inactive';
```

Deletes orders from **inactive customers**.

> ✅ `DELETE o` ensures only rows from `orders` are deleted, not from `customers`.

---

## 🔒 **Safe Practice (Optional)**

Enable safe update mode in MySQL Workbench:

- It prevents running `DELETE` without a `WHERE` clause or key.
    
- Go to **Edit > Preferences > SQL Editor > Safe Updates**.
    

---

Need help with deleting based on a subquery, or cascading delete (foreign key)? Just ask.
