# Installation procedure

- create a folder and open that folder in vscode 
- go to terminal and switch to command prompt (cmd)
- type "npm init" or "npm init -y" this will create a package.json file - using this we can download different packages ( npm stands for node packet manager )
- In package.json an key named dependencies is present which holds the different libraries that are installed. 
- Then create a script file for writing node ( script.js )
- Then do the code editing and writing in that section.
- If we wanna know the current file name:- console.log( _ _ filename); //This will show the file name in the terminal

# what is node.js?

Node.js is open-source, cross-platform Javascript runtime environment.

Node.js is a **runtime environment** that lets you run JavaScript outside the browser, like on a server. Here's what that means, explained simply:

(=>A **runtime environment** is a collection of software and resources that a program needs to execute or "run." It provides the essential tools, services, and settings required for a program to function during its execution. Think of it as the ecosystem where a program operates, including the hardware, operating system, and software libraries.)

### Key Points:-

1. **Runs JavaScript Anywhere**:
    
    - Normally, JavaScript works only in browsers (like Chrome or Firefox). Node.js lets you use JavaScript on your computer or server to build applications.
    
2. **Powered by V8 Engine**:
    
    - Node.js uses the same engine that runs JavaScript in Google Chrome (called **V8**) to execute your code super fast.
    
3. **Build Backend Applications**:
    
    - You can use Node.js to create the "backend" (the part of an app that handles data, logic, and server requests).
    
4. **Non-Blocking and Fast**:
    
    - Node.js uses a special "non-blocking" way to handle tasks, which makes it great for building apps that need to handle a lot of requests quickly, like chat apps or online games.
    
5. **Rich Library Support**:
    
    - Node.js has a built-in package manager called **npm** (Node Package Manager). It gives you access to thousands of ready-made tools and libraries to speed up your development.
    
6. **Popular Use Cases**:
    
    - **Web Servers**: Building websites and APIs.
    - **Real-time Apps**: Like chat apps or live notifications.
    - **Command-Line Tools**: For automation and scripts.
    - **File Operations**: Reading, writing, or modifying files.
    
    



# what is API?
![[Pasted image 20241230103910.png]]


An **API** often serves as the bridge that connects the **front end** (what users see and interact with) and the **back end** (where the data and logic live) of a web application. Here's how it works:

---

### **How APIs Connect Front End and Back End:**

1. **Front End**:
    
    - This is the user interface built with technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    - Users interact with buttons, forms, and other elements.
      
2. **API as the Middleman**:
    
    - When a user performs an action (e.g., clicking a "Submit" button), the front end sends a request to the back end via the API.
    - The API formats the request and ensures the back end understands it.
      
3. **Back End**:
    
    - The back end, typically built with server-side languages like Node.js, Python, or PHP, processes the request.
    - It fetches or updates data from the database and sends a response back via the API.
      
4. **Response to the Front End**:
    
    - The API delivers the back end's response (e.g., data or confirmation).
    - The front end uses this response to update the user interface.

---

### **Example: Logging into a Website**

- **Front End**:
    
    - The user enters a username and password in a form and clicks "Login."
    - This triggers a **POST request** to the back end via the API.
      
- **API Request**:
    
   ```
` ```http
    POST https://example.com/api/login
    {
      "username": "john_doe",
      "password": "secure123"
    }
    ```
    
- **Back End**:
    
    - The server checks the credentials against the database.
    - If correct, it responds with a success message and maybe a token for authentication.
      
- **API Response**:
    
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "token": "abc123"
    }
    ```
    
- **Front End**:
    
    - The front end receives this response and updates the UI to show the logged-in user dashboard.

---

### **Benefits of Using an API for Front End and Back End Communication:**

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
    - The front end and back end can be developed independently.
2. **Scalability**:
    - APIs make it easy to handle multiple types of clients (e.g., web apps, mobile apps) with the same back end.
3. **Flexibility**:
    - You can change the front end or back end without affecting the other, as long as the API remains consistent.

In short, APIs are the glue that holds the front end and back end together in modern web development.`



# What is a Node Module?

A **Node module** is a block of code (or file) that does a specific task and can be reused in your Node.js applications. You can think of it as a toolbox with tools for common tasks like reading files, making web requests, or creating servers.

In Node.js, modules are used to organize your code into smaller, manageable parts. They also allow you to use built-in tools provided by Node.js or download tools made by other developers.

---

### **Why Use Node Modules?**

1. **Reusability:** Write code once and use it multiple times.
2. **Organization:** Split your code into smaller parts so it’s easier to manage.
3. **Collaboration:** Use modules made by other developers to save time and effort.
4. **Built-in Tools:** Node.js has built-in modules for common tasks like working with files or networks.

---

### **Types of Node Modules**

1. **Built-in Modules:** Node.js provides ready-to-use modules like:
    
    - **`fs`** for working with files.
    - **`http`** for creating servers.
    - **`path`** for working with file paths.
    
    Example: Using the built-in `fs` module to create a file:
    
    ```javascript
    const fs = require('fs');
    fs.writeFileSync('example.txt', 'Hello, Node.js!');
    ```
    
2. **Custom Modules(Local modules):** You can create your own module to reuse your code.  
    Example:
    
    - **File `math.js`:**
        
        ```javascript
        module.exports.add = (a, b) => a + b;
        ```
        
    - **File `app.js`:**
        
        ```javascript
        const math = require('./math');
        console.log(math.add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
        ```
        
3. **Third-party Modules:** These are tools built by other developers and shared via **npm (Node Package Manager)**.  
    Example: Install `lodash` for utility functions:
    
    ```bash
    npm install lodash
    ```
    
    Use it in your code:
    
    ```javascript
    const _ = require('lodash');
    console.log(_.shuffle([1, 2, 3, 4])); // Shuffles the array
    ```
    

---

### **Key Benefits of Using Node Modules**

- **Saves Time:** You don’t have to write everything from scratch.
- **Keeps Code Clean:** Helps break your code into smaller, logical pieces.
- **Easy Collaboration:** Share code with others or use code written by others.
- **Standard Tools:** Use Node's built-in modules to perform tasks like reading files or creating a server.

---

### **Summary in Simple Words**

A Node module is like a box of tools for developers. You can use tools built into Node.js, create your own tools, or borrow tools from others (via npm). Modules help you save time, stay organized, and build apps faster!


# Imports 

In **Node.js**, **imports** are used to bring in external modules, libraries, or custom code into your application. This allows you to use code from other files or packages without rewriting it. Imports are a fundamental concept in modular programming, making it easier to manage and reuse code.

---

### **Why Are Imports Important?**

- **Code Reusability:** Avoid repeating code by splitting functionality into separate files or modules.
- **Collaboration:** Easily share and use code created by others, such as npm packages.
- **Maintainability:** Organize your code into smaller, manageable parts.

---

### **Two Ways to Import in Node.js**

Node.js supports two module systems:

1. **CommonJS (CJS)**: Uses `require` to import.
2. **ES Modules (ESM)**: Uses `import` to import.

### **1. CommonJS (CJS) Modules**

- **Default module system in Node.js** (introduced in the early days).
- Uses `require` to import modules and `module.exports` (or `exports`) to export functionality.
- Executes modules synchronously and is easy to understand for beginners.

#### **Example of CommonJS:**

**mathUtils.js** (Custom Module):

```javascript
// Exporting functions using CommonJS
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}

// Export the functions
module.exports = { add, subtract };
```

**index.js** (Main File):

```javascript
// Importing the custom module using require (CommonJS)
const mathUtils = require('./mathUtils');

// Use the exported functions
console.log(mathUtils.add(10, 5));      // Output: 15
console.log(mathUtils.subtract(10, 5)); // Output: 5
```

---

### **2. ECMAScript Modules (ESM)**

- Introduced as part of modern JavaScript (ES6/ES2015).
- Uses `import` to bring in modules and `export` to share functionality.
- Requires the file extension `.mjs` or the `"type": "module"` setting in `package.json` to work in Node.js.

#### **Example of ES Modules:**

**mathUtils.mjs** (Custom Module):

```javascript
// Exporting functions using ES Modules
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

export function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}
```

**index.mjs** (Main File):

```javascript
// Importing the custom module using import (ES Modules)
import { add, subtract } from './mathUtils.mjs';

// Use the exported functions
console.log(add(10, 5));      // Output: 15
console.log(subtract(10, 5)); // Output: 5
```

---

### **Key Differences Between CommonJS and ES Modules**

|Feature|CommonJS (CJS)|ES Modules (ESM)|
|---|---|---|
|**Import Syntax**|`require('./module')`|`import from './module'`|
|**Export Syntax**|`module.exports` or `exports`|`export` or `export default`|
|**File Extension**|`.js` (default)|`.mjs` or `"type": "module"` in `package.json`|
|**Execution**|Synchronous|Asynchronous|
|**Usage**|Backward compatibility|Modern JavaScript apps|

---

### **When to Use Each?**

1. **CommonJS**: Ideal for traditional Node.js projects or when using older libraries.
2. **ES Modules**: Recommended for modern JavaScript projects and compatibility with browser-based JavaScript.

---

### **Mixed Usage Warning**

You cannot mix `require` and `import` in the same file. Stick to one module system per file or project.

#### Example:

This will **NOT** work:

```javascript
import { add } from './mathUtils.mjs';
const mathUtils = require('./mathUtils.js'); // Error: Cannot use require and import together.
```

---

### **Summary**

- CommonJS is easier to start with in Node.js because it's widely supported and simpler.
- ES Modules are the future and align with modern JavaScript standards.

For new projects, consider using **ES Modules** for better compatibility and future-proofing your code.





# Module Scope in Node.js 

In **Node.js**, every file you create is treated as a **module**. **Module Scope** means that the variables, functions, and objects you define inside a module (file) are **private** to that module by default. They are **not accessible** in other files unless you explicitly export them.

---

### **Understanding Module Scope with an Example**

Let’s say you have a file called **math.js**:

```js
// math.js
let secretNumber = 42;  // This is private (module scope)

function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

module.exports = add; // Only exporting 'add' function
```

Here:  
✅ `add()` is exported, so it can be used in other files.  
❌ `secretNumber` is **not exported**, so it **cannot be accessed** outside this file.

Now, in **app.js**, let’s try using the math module:

```js
// app.js
const add = require('./math'); // Importing the 'add' function

console.log(add(5, 3)); // ✅ Works! Output: 8
console.log(secretNumber); // ❌ ERROR! 'secretNumber' is not accessible
```

---

### **Key Points About Module Scope in Node.js**

1. **Each file is its own module.**
2. **Variables and functions inside a module are private by default.**
3. **To share something (make it public), you must export it using `module.exports`.**
4. **To use an exported value in another file, you must import it using `require()`.**

---

### **Why is Module Scope Important?**

- **Prevents conflicts** (Variables in different files won’t accidentally overwrite each other).
- **Encapsulates code** (Keeps related functionality together).
- **Improves security** (Sensitive data stays hidden inside the module).

# Importing JSON Files in Node.js 

In Node.js, **CommonJS** is the default module system (unless explicitly using ES Modules). One of the simplest ways to load a JSON file in a **CommonJS-based** Node.js application is by using the `require()` function. This method is widely used because it's straightforward and requires minimal setup.

---

## **1. Understanding `require()` in Node.js**

The `require()` function is used to **import modules, JSON files, or other JavaScript files** in Node.js. When applied to a JSON file, `require()` automatically:

1. **Reads the JSON file** from the specified location.
2. **Parses the JSON data** into a JavaScript object.
3. **Returns the parsed object**, making it directly accessible within your script.

---

## **2. Example: Importing a JSON File Using `require()`**

Let's assume we have a JSON file named `data.json` with the following content:

### **data.json**

json

CopyEdit

`{   "name": "Achyuth J",   "age": 25,   "skills": ["JavaScript", "Node.js", "MongoDB"] }`

### **Importing this JSON file in a Node.js script using `require()`**

javascript

CopyEdit

`const data = require('./data.json');  console.log(data);`

### **Output:**

plaintext

CopyEdit

`{   name: 'Achyuth J',   age: 25,   skills: [ 'JavaScript', 'Node.js', 'MongoDB' ] }`

💡 **Here’s what happens step by step:**

4. **`require('./data.json')`** loads the JSON file.
5. **Node.js reads the file** and automatically converts the JSON string into a **JavaScript object**.
6. The parsed object is assigned to the `data` variable.
7. Finally, `console.log(data);` prints the object to the console.

# What is a Module Wrapper Function in Node.js?

In Node.js, every module (file) is wrapped in a **Module Wrapper Function** before it is executed. This wrapper function provides a private scope for the module, ensuring that the variables and functions defined inside one module do not conflict with those in another module. It also allows Node.js to inject specific arguments and features into the module.

---

### **The Module Wrapper Function**

When a module is loaded, Node.js wraps the code in the following function:

```javascript
(function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
  // Module code goes here
});
```

### **Key Points**

8. **Encapsulation**:
    
    - This function ensures that variables and functions declared in one module are private to that module and cannot interfere with other modules.
    - For example:
        
        ```javascript
        let a = 10; // This variable is private to this module.
        ```
        
9. **Arguments Provided**: The function provides these arguments automatically:
    
    - `exports`: A shortcut to export module contents.
    - `require`: A function to import other modules.
    - `module`: An object representing the current module.
    - `__filename`: The absolute path to the current file.
    - `__dirname`: The absolute path to the current directory.

---

### **How It Works**

Consider this simple module:

**mathUtils.js**:

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
module.exports = add;
```

Internally, Node.js wraps this file like this:

```javascript
(function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
  const add = (a, b) => a + b;
  module.exports = add;
});
```

This ensures the `add` function and any other variable declared in this module do not pollute the global scope.

---

### **Benefits of Module Wrapper Function**

10. **Encapsulation**: Keeps the global scope clean and avoids variable conflicts.
11. **Automatic Features**: Provides useful arguments like `__filename` and `__dirname`.
12. **Modularity**: Encourages modular programming by separating code into distinct files.
13. **Cross-Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with Node.js's module system.

---

### **Accessing the Arguments**

You can use the provided arguments in your code:

```javascript
// Example: Using __dirname and __filename
console.log('Current directory:', __dirname);
console.log('Current file:', __filename);

// Example: Using exports and module.exports
exports.myFunction = () => console.log('Hello');
```

---

### **Summary**

The **Module Wrapper Function** is a feature in Node.js that wraps your code to:

- Create a private scope for each module.
- Provide useful arguments (`exports`, `require`, `module`, `__filename`, `__dirname`) for seamless module handling.

This design makes Node.js modules safe, organized, and easy to use.



# Module Caching in Node.js 

### **What is Module Caching in Node.js?**

When you use `require()` to import a module in Node.js, **Node loads and executes that module only once** and then stores it in **memory (cache)**. If you `require()` the same module again, **Node does not reload the file but instead returns the cached version**.

This caching system helps **improve performance** because:  
✅ The module doesn’t have to be reloaded every time it’s required.  
✅ The module’s code doesn’t run multiple times unnecessarily.  
✅ It saves processing time and memory.

---

## **🔹 Let’s Understand with a Simple Example**

### **Step 1: Create a Module (math.js)**

Imagine we have a file named **math.js** that contains a simple function:

```js
// math.js
console.log("Math module is loaded!");  // This will print only once

module.exports = {
    add: (a, b) => a + b,
};
```

- The **console.log("Math module is loaded!")** is there just to check when the module is loaded.
- We export an **add function** that adds two numbers.

---

### **Step 2: Import the Module in Another File (app.js)**

Now, let’s use this module in another file called **app.js**:

```js
// app.js
const math1 = require('./math');
const math2 = require('./math'); 

console.log(math1.add(2, 3)); // ✅ Output: 5
console.log(math2.add(4, 6)); // ✅ Output: 10
```

---

### **Expected Output:**

```
Math module is loaded!
5
10
```

---

### **What Just Happened?**

- **Step 1:** When `require('./math')` is called for the **first time**, Node **loads and executes** the `math.js` file.
- **Step 2:** The message **"Math module is loaded!"** is printed (because the file was executed).
- **Step 3:** The exported function `add()` is used.
- **Step 4:** When `require('./math')` is called **again**, Node **does not reload the file**.
    - Instead, it **uses the cached version** from memory.
    - That’s why **"Math module is loaded!"** is printed **only once**, even though we required `math.js` twice.

---

## **🔹 Where is the Cache Stored?**

Node.js stores all cached modules in `require.cache`, which is an object that holds all required modules.

To check the cache, add this to your code:

```js
console.log(require.cache);
```

This will print an object containing paths of all loaded modules.

---

## **🔹 When is Module Caching Useful?**

### ✅ **Improves Performance**

- Prevents unnecessary re-execution of the same file.
- Reduces disk reads and execution time.

### ✅ **Ensures Singleton Behavior**

- Some modules (like database connections) should be **created only once**.
- Caching makes sure that the same instance is reused.

Example:

```js
// db.js (Database Connection)
console.log("Database connected!");

module.exports = {
    connect: () => console.log("Using the database connection"),
};
```

Now, if you `require('./db')` multiple times, the **database connection message** will be printed only **once**.

---

## **🔹 What If You Want to Reload a Module?**

Sometimes, you might want to **clear the cache** and reload a module, especially when dealing with **dynamic configurations**.

### **How to Clear Cache?**

```js
delete require.cache[require.resolve('./math')];
```

Now, if you `require('./math')` again, Node will **reload the module from scratch**.

---

## **🔹 Summary**

✔ **Node.js loads a module only once and caches it.**  
✔ **Subsequent `require()` calls return the cached version.**  
✔ **This improves performance and prevents redundant execution.**  
✔ **You can manually clear the cache if needed.**

Would you like a real-world example where caching is useful? 😊
# Built-in modules in nodejs
14.  **OS module**  
   The **`os` module** in Node.js is a built-in module that provides operating system-related utilities for interacting with and gathering information about the system where the Node.js application is running. This module allows developers to access various details about the operating system and perform system-level operations. Read more about this module in https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/os.html .

15. **Path module** 
   The **`path` module** in Node.js is a built-in module used to work with file and directory paths. It provides utilities for handling and transforming file paths in a way that is consistent across different operating systems, making it easier to write cross-platform Node.js applications.
   You can read more about path module in https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/path.html .

Node.js provides several **built-in modules** that help developers perform various tasks without needing external libraries. These modules are included with Node.js and can be imported using `require()` or ES module `import`.

### 🔹 Common Built-in Modules in Node.js

|Module|Description|
|---|---|
|**fs (File System)**|Handles file operations like reading, writing, and deleting files.|
|**http**|Creates HTTP servers and makes HTTP requests.|
|**https**|Handles secure HTTPS requests.|

### 🔹 Examples of Some Built-in Modules

#### 1️⃣ **`fs` (File System) - Reading a File**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
});
```

#### 2️⃣ **`http` - Creating a Simple HTTP Server**

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('Hello, Node.js!');
});

server.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

#### 3️⃣ **`path` - Working with File Paths**

```javascript
const path = require('path');

console.log(path.join(__dirname, 'files', 'example.txt')); // Outputs full path
```

#### 4️⃣ **`crypto` - Hashing a Password**

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update('password123').digest('hex');
console.log(hash); // Prints hashed password
```

---

### 🔹 How to Use Built-in Modules?

Simply `require()` them:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');  // File System
const http = require('http');  // HTTP Server
const path = require('path');  // Path Utilities
```

Would you like examples of any specific module? 🚀


# FS module 

The `fs` module in Node.js stands for **File System**. It allows you to work with files on your computer, such as reading, writing, updating, and deleting files. It provides both **asynchronous (non-blocking)** and **synchronous (blocking)** methods for these operations.

---

### Key Concepts

17. **Asynchronous (Non-blocking)**: Operations don't block the execution of the code. Instead, they use callbacks to handle the results.
18. **Synchronous (Blocking)**: Operations block the execution of the code until the task is complete.

---

### **fs.readFile**

Reads the content of a file asynchronously. It doesn’t block the execution while waiting for the file to be read.

**Syntax**:

```javascript
fs.readFile(path, options, callback)
```

- `path`: Path to the file to read.
- `options`: Optional encoding (e.g., `'utf8'`).
- `callback`: Function to handle the result (`err`, `data`).

**Example**:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error reading the file:', err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('File content:', data);
});

console.log('This prints first because readFile is asynchronous!');
```

---

### **fs.readFileSync**

Reads the content of a file synchronously. It blocks the execution until the file is read.

**Syntax**:

```javascript
fs.readFileSync(path, options)
```

- `path`: Path to the file.
- `options`: Optional encoding (e.g., `'utf8'`).

**Example**:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

try {
  const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8');
  console.log('File content:', data);
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Error reading the file:', err);
}

console.log('This prints after reading the file because readFileSync is synchronous!');
```

---

### **fs.writeFile**

Writes data to a file asynchronously. If the file doesn’t exist, it creates the file.

**Syntax**:

```javascript
fs.writeFile(path, data, options, callback)
```

- `path`: Path to the file to write.
- `data`: Content to write to the file.
- `options`: Optional encoding (e.g., `'utf8'`).
- `callback`: Function to handle completion (`err`).

**Example**:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFile('output.txt', 'Hello, World!', 'utf8', (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error writing to the file:', err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('File written successfully!');
});
```

---

### **fs.writeFileSync**

Writes data to a file synchronously. Blocks execution until the file is written.

**Syntax**:

```javascript
fs.writeFileSync(path, data, options)
```

- `path`: Path to the file.
- `data`: Content to write to the file.
- `options`: Optional encoding (e.g., `'utf8'`).

**Example**:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

try {
  fs.writeFileSync('output.txt', 'Hello, Sync World!', 'utf8');
  console.log('File written successfully!');
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Error writing to the file:', err);
}
```

---
### **fs.appendFile() - Add content to a file**

This method **adds new content to an existing file** without deleting the previous content. If the file doesn’t exist, it creates one.

Example:

```js
const fs = require("fs");

fs.appendFile("notes.txt", "This is a new line of text.\n", (err) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error("Error appending file:", err);
        return;
    }
    console.log("Content added successfully!");
});
```

How it works:

- If `notes.txt` already exists, `"This is a new line of text."` is added at the end.
- If the file doesn’t exist, it **creates** a new file and writes the text.

---

### **fs.unlink() - Delete a file**

This method **removes a file from the system** permanently.

Example:

```js
fs.unlink("notes.txt", (err) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error("Error deleting file:", err);
        return;
    }
    console.log("File deleted successfully!");
});
```

How it works:

- If `notes.txt` exists, it is **deleted**.
- If the file does not exist, an **error** occurs.

---

### **fs.mkdir() - Create a folder**

This method **creates a new directory (folder)**.

Example:

```js
fs.mkdir("myFolder", (err) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error("Error creating folder:", err);
        return;
    }
    console.log("Folder created successfully!");
});
```

How it works:

- If `myFolder` does not exist, it is created.
- If the folder already exists, an **error occurs** unless we add `{ recursive: true }` to create parent folders if needed.

Example with recursive option:

```js
fs.mkdir("parentFolder/childFolder", { recursive: true }, (err) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error("Error creating folders:", err);
        return;
    }
    console.log("Nested folders created successfully!");
});
```

1️⃣ **`fs.mkdir("parentFolder/childFolder", ... )`**

- This tells Node.js to create `childFolder` inside `parentFolder`.

2️⃣ **`{ recursive: true }`**

- This ensures that **if `parentFolder` does not exist**, it will be created automatically before `childFolder`.

3️⃣ **Callback function `(err) => { ... }`**

- If an error occurs (like **no permission** to create folders), it logs `"Error creating folders"`.
- If successful, it logs `"Nested folders created successfully!"`.
---

### **fs.readdir() - List files in a folder**

This method **reads the contents of a directory** and lists all files and folders inside.

Example:

```js
fs.readdir(".", (err, files) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error("Error reading directory:", err);
        return;
    }
    console.log("Files in directory:", files);
});
```

How it works:

- `"."` represents the **current folder**.
- It lists all **files and folders** in the directory.

If you want to read files from a specific folder:

```js
fs.readdir("myFolder", (err, files) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error("Error reading folder:", err);
        return;
    }
    console.log("Files inside myFolder:", files);
});
```

This will list all files inside `myFolder`.


### Key Differences Between Async and Sync

|**Asynchronous**|**Synchronous**|
|---|---|
|Non-blocking execution|Blocking execution|
|Requires a callback to handle results|Directly returns results or throws errors|
|Better for performance in large applications|Simpler for smaller tasks or scripts|

---

### **When to Use What?**

- **Use asynchronous methods** for performance, especially in large applications or when handling many files.
- **Use synchronous methods** when you need simplicity and don't care about blocking execution (e.g., scripts or small utilities).

These methods allow Node.js to work effectively with the file system while offering flexibility for both performance and simplicity.


# fs/promises module

The `fs/promises` module provides **Promise-based** versions of file system methods, allowing you to use **async/await** instead of callbacks. This makes the code cleaner and easier to manage.

To use it:
```js
const fs = require("fs/promises");
```
#### Using Both `async/await` and `.then().catch()` in fs/promises**

Here’s a side-by-side comparison of using **`async/await`** and **`.then().catch()`** for the same file operations.

---

### **1. Writing to a File**

✅ **Using `async/await`**

```js
const fs = require("fs/promises");

async function writeFile() {
    try {
        await fs.writeFile("example.txt", "Hello, Node.js!");
        console.log("File written successfully!");
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error writing file:", error);
    }
}

writeFile();
```

✅ **Using `.then().catch()`**

```js
fs.writeFile("example.txt", "Hello, Node.js!")
    .then(() => console.log("File written successfully!"))
    .catch((error) => console.error("Error writing file:", error));
```

---

### **2. Reading a File**

✅ **Using `async/await`**

```js
async function readFile() {
    try {
        const data = await fs.readFile("example.txt", "utf-8");
        console.log("File content:", data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error reading file:", error);
    }
}

readFile();
```

✅ **Using `.then().catch()`**

```js
fs.readFile("example.txt", "utf-8")
    .then((data) => console.log("File content:", data))
    .catch((error) => console.error("Error reading file:", error));
```

---

### **3. Appending to a File**

✅ **Using `async/await`**

```js
async function appendFile() {
    try {
        await fs.appendFile("example.txt", "\nAppending new text!");
        console.log("Content added successfully!");
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error appending file:", error);
    }
}

appendFile();
```

✅ **Using `.then().catch()`**

```js
fs.appendFile("example.txt", "\nAppending new text!")
    .then(() => console.log("Content added successfully!"))
    .catch((error) => console.error("Error appending file:", error));
```

---

### **4. Deleting a File**

✅ **Using `async/await`**

```js
async function deleteFile() {
    try {
        await fs.unlink("example.txt");
        console.log("File deleted successfully!");
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error deleting file:", error);
    }
}

deleteFile();
```

✅ **Using `.then().catch()`**

```js
fs.unlink("example.txt")
    .then(() => console.log("File deleted successfully!"))
    .catch((error) => console.error("Error deleting file:", error));
```

---

### **5. Creating a Folder**

✅ **Using `async/await`**

```js
async function createFolder() {
    try {
        await fs.mkdir("myFolder", { recursive: true });
        console.log("Folder created successfully!");
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error creating folder:", error);
    }
}

createFolder();
```

✅ **Using `.then().catch()`**

```js
fs.mkdir("myFolder", { recursive: true })
    .then(() => console.log("Folder created successfully!"))
    .catch((error) => console.error("Error creating folder:", error));
```

---

### **6. Reading Files in a Folder**

✅ **Using `async/await`**

```js
async function readFolder() {
    try {
        const files = await fs.readdir(".");
        console.log("Files in directory:", files);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error reading directory:", error);
    }
}

readFolder();
```

✅ **Using `.then().catch()`**

```js
fs.readdir(".")
    .then((files) => console.log("Files in directory:", files))
    .catch((error) => console.error("Error reading directory:", error));
```

---

### **Which One Should You Use?**

|Feature|`async/await`|`.then().catch()`|
|---|---|---|
|Readability|Easier to read, looks synchronous|Harder to read with long chains|
|Error Handling|Uses `try/catch`|Uses `.catch()`|
|Best For|Complex logic with multiple async calls|Simple one-liners|

For small file operations, **`.then().catch()`** is fine, but for **larger projects**, `async/await` is **better** for readability.

# Streams and Pipes in Node.js

Streams and pipes help in handling **large amounts of data efficiently** without loading everything into memory at once.

### **Streams**

A **stream** is a way of **reading or writing data in chunks** instead of all at once.

- **Example:** Watching a YouTube video—data loads and plays at the same time.
- Used for handling **files, network data, audio/video, etc.**

#### **Types of Streams**

1. **Readable Stream** → Reads data (e.g., reading a file).
2. **Writable Stream** → Writes data (e.g., saving data to a file).
3. **Duplex Stream** → Reads and writes (e.g., network sockets).
4. **Transform Stream** → Modifies data while streaming (e.g., compressing files).

#### **Example: Reading a File Using a Stream**

```js
const fs = require("fs");

const readableStream = fs.createReadStream("example.txt", "utf-8");

readableStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log("Received data chunk:", chunk);
});
```

- The file is **read in chunks** instead of loading it all at once.

---

### **Pipes**

A **pipe** is a method used to **connect a readable stream to a writable stream**.

- **Example:** Filling a bucket with water using a pipe.
- Pipes **automate data flow** between streams.

#### **Example: Reading from a File and Writing to Another**

```js
const fs = require("fs");

const readableStream = fs.createReadStream("input.txt", "utf-8");
const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream("output.txt");

readableStream.pipe(writableStream);

console.log("File copied successfully!");
```

- **No need to manually handle chunks**—pipe does it automatically.
- **Efficient and memory-friendly**.

### **Key Differences**

|Feature|Streams|Pipes|
|---|---|---|
|**What it does**|Handles data flow|Connects streams|
|**How it works**|Reads/writes in chunks|Automates stream connection|
|**Example**|Reading a file|Copying a file using read & write streams|

# Absolute vs. Relative Path in Node.js

#### **1. Absolute Path**

An absolute path is a full path that starts from the root directory (`/` on Linux/macOS or `C:\` on Windows). It defines the exact location of a file or directory in the file system, independent of the current working directory.

✅ **Example Absolute Paths:**

- **Windows:** `C:\Users\Achyuth\Documents\file.txt`
- **Linux/macOS:** `/home/achyuth/Documents/file.txt`

🔹 **Checking an Absolute Path in Node.js**

```js
const path = require('path');

console.log(path.isAbsolute('/users/achyuth/docs/file.txt')); // true (Linux/macOS)
console.log(path.isAbsolute('C:\\Users\\Achyuth\\file.txt')); // true (Windows)
```

---

#### **2. Relative Path**

A relative path is defined in relation to the current working directory. It does not start from the root but rather from where the script is being executed.

✅ **Example Relative Paths:**

- `docs/file.txt`
- `../file.txt` (moves up one directory)
- `./file.txt` (refers to the current directory)

🔹 **Checking a Relative Path in Node.js**

```js
console.log(path.isAbsolute('docs/file.txt')); // false
console.log(path.isAbsolute('./file.txt')); // false
console.log(path.isAbsolute('../file.txt')); // false
```

---

### **🔹 Converting Relative Path to Absolute Path**

You can use `path.resolve()` to get the absolute path from a relative path:

```js
console.log(path.resolve('docs/file.txt')); 
// Output: /Users/achyuth/projects/docs/file.txt (example output on macOS)
```

# Path module

The `path` module in Node.js is a built-in module that provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. It makes it easier to manipulate and resolve file paths across different operating systems. For instance, Windows uses backslashes (`\`), while Linux and macOS use forward slashes (`/`). The `path` module ensures compatibility and simplifies path handling.

---

### Key Features of the `path` Module

19. **Platform Independence**: Handles file paths correctly across different operating systems.
20. **Path Manipulation**: Allows you to work with file paths—join, resolve, parse, and normalize paths.
21. **Utility Functions**: Offers various methods to extract parts of a path like the directory, base name, extension, etc.

---

### Common Methods in the `path` Module

#### 1. **`path.join()`**

Combines multiple path segments into a single normalized path.

```javascript
const path = require('path');

const fullPath = path.join('users', 'achyuth', 'documents', 'file.txt');
console.log(fullPath); // Output: 'users/achyuth/documents/file.txt'
```

---

#### 2. **`path.resolve()`**

The `path.resolve()` method in Node.js is used to **convert relative paths into absolute paths** by resolving a sequence of path segments. It helps ensure that you're always working with a full, absolute path instead of a partial or relative one.

---

###### **How It Works**

🔹 **Basic Syntax:**

```js
path.resolve(...paths)
```

- Takes multiple path segments as arguments.
- Resolves them into an absolute path.
- If no arguments are provided, it returns the absolute path of the current working directory.

---

##### **1️⃣ Example: Converting a Relative Path to Absolute**

```js
const path = require('path');

console.log(path.resolve('docs', 'file.txt')); 
// Output: /Users/achyuth/projects/docs/file.txt (Example on macOS/Linux)
// Output: C:\Users\Achyuth\projects\docs\file.txt (Windows)
```

🔍 **What’s Happening?**

- It starts from the **current working directory** (where the script runs).
- Joins `"docs"` and `"file.txt"`.
- Returns an absolute path.

---

##### **2️⃣ Example: Resolving Parent Directory (`..`)**

```js
console.log(path.resolve('docs', '..', 'images', 'pic.png'));
```

🔍 **Breakdown:**

- `"docs"` → First folder
- `".."` → Moves **one level up**
- `"images/pic.png"` → Joins with the new path

👀 **Final Output:**  
`/Users/achyuth/projects/images/pic.png`

---

##### **3️⃣ Example: If a Path is Already Absolute**

```js
console.log(path.resolve('/home/achyuth', 'docs', 'file.txt'));
```

🔍 **What Happens?**

- Since `/home/achyuth` is an **absolute path**, `path.resolve()` ignores the current working directory.
- It directly appends `"docs/file.txt"` to `/home/achyuth`.

👀 **Output:**  
`/home/achyuth/docs/file.txt`

---

##### **4️⃣ Example: When a Path Starts with `/` or `C:\`**

```js
console.log(path.resolve('/var/www', 'projects', '/newsite'));
```

🔍 **What Happens?**

- The **last absolute path** (`/newsite`) **resets everything before it**.
- It ignores `/var/www` and `projects`, and only returns `/newsite`.

👀 **Output:**  
`/newsite`

---

##### **5️⃣ Example: No Arguments (Returns Current Directory)**

```js
console.log(path.resolve());
```

👀 **Output:**  
Returns the absolute path of the current working directory (CWD).

Example Output:  
`/Users/achyuth/projects`

---

##### **🔹 Summary of `path.resolve()` Behavior**

|Case|Output Behavior|
|---|---|
|Relative paths|Resolves from **current working directory**|
|`..` (parent directory)|Moves up one level|
|Absolute path in arguments|Ignores previous paths and starts from that absolute path|
|No arguments|Returns the current working directory|

---

#### 3. **`path.basename()`**

Returns the last portion (file name) of a path.

```javascript
const path = require('path');

const filePath = '/users/achyuth/documents/file.txt';
console.log(path.basename(filePath)); // Output: 'file.txt'
```

---

#### 4. **`path.dirname()`**

Returns the directory name of a path.

```javascript
const path = require('path');

const filePath = '/users/achyuth/documents/file.txt';
console.log(path.dirname(filePath)); // Output: '/users/achyuth/documents'
```

---

#### 5. **`path.extname()`**

Returns the file extension of a path.

```javascript
const path = require('path');

const filePath = '/users/achyuth/documents/file.txt';
console.log(path.extname(filePath)); // Output: '.txt'
```

---

#### 6. **`path.parse()`**

Returns an object with details about the path, including the root, directory, base, name, and extension.

```javascript
const path = require('path');

const filePath = '/users/achyuth/documents/file.txt';
console.log(path.parse(filePath));
// Output: 
// {
//   root: '/',
//   dir: '/users/achyuth/documents',
//   base: 'file.txt',
//   ext: '.txt',
//   name: 'file'
// }
```

---

#### 7. **`path.format()`**

Takes an object as input and returns a formatted path string.

```javascript
const path = require('path');

const pathObj = {
  dir: '/users/achyuth/documents',
  base: 'file.txt',
};

console.log(path.format(pathObj)); // Output: '/users/achyuth/documents/file.txt'88

```

#### **8.`path.isAbsolute(path)`**

- Checks if a path is absolute.
- Example:
    ```js
      console.log(path.isAbsolute('/users/achyuth')); // Output: true
      console.log(path.isAbsolute('./docs/file.txt')); // Output: false
     ```

---

### Example: Using `path` Module in a Script

```javascript
const path = require('path');

// Example file path
const filePath = '/users/achyuth/documents/file.txt';

// Extracting parts of the path
console.log('Directory:', path.dirname(filePath)); // '/users/achyuth/documents'
console.log('File Name:', path.basename(filePath)); // 'file.txt'
console.log('Extension:', path.extname(filePath)); // '.txt'

// Combining paths
const newPath = path.join('/users', 'achyuth', 'projects', 'newFile.js');
console.log('New Path:', newPath);

// Resolving to absolute path
const absolutePath = path.resolve('users', 'achyuth', 'projects', 'newFile.js');
console.log('Absolute Path:', absolutePath);
```

---

### When to Use the `path` Module

2. **File and Directory Management**: Navigating through file systems and directories.
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Handling paths on different operating systems.
4. **Path Normalization**: Ensuring paths are consistent and valid.
5. **Building Dynamic File Paths**: Dynamically creating file paths based on user input or system conditions.

The `path` module is essential when working with file systems in Node.js applications, ensuring smooth and error-free path handling.
# Character Set and Encoding in Node.js

Alright, imagine you're writing a **secret message** to your friend. You don’t want others to understand it, so you use a **special code** (like replacing "A" with "1", "B" with "2", etc.).

This is what **character encoding** does! It **changes letters into numbers** or **different formats** so computers can understand and store them.

---

## **1️⃣ What is a Character Set? (Like an Alphabet 📖)**

A **character set** is like a **collection of letters and symbols** that a computer understands.

For example:

- **ASCII** (like a simple alphabet, only A-Z, 0-9, and symbols).
- **UTF-8** (a big alphabet with letters from all languages, even emojis! 😃🎉).

💡 Think of it like a **language** a computer speaks! Some computers can only understand **basic English (ASCII)**, but others can read **all world languages (UTF-8)**.

---

## **2️⃣ What is Encoding? (Secret Code 🕵️)**

**Encoding** is how we turn letters into **computer language (numbers and symbols)**.

🔹 **Example:**  
Imagine the word **"HELLO"** → The computer doesn’t store it as letters but as numbers:

```plaintext
H = 72, E = 69, L = 76, L = 76, O = 79
```

This is called **UTF-8 encoding**.

💡 **Encoding = Writing letters in a secret way so the computer understands them!**

---

## **3️⃣ Encoding in Node.js (Like a Magic Notebook ✨)**

Node.js has a **magic notebook** called `Buffer`. It helps store and read encoded text.

✅ **Example: Changing "Hello" to Computer Code**

```js
const buf = Buffer.from('Hello', 'utf-8');
console.log(buf);
```

🔹 **Output:**

```plaintext
<Buffer 48 65 6c 6c 6f>
```

Each letter is **converted into numbers** (like a secret code).

---

## **4️⃣ How to Read Encoded Text?**

If your friend gets your **secret message**, they need a **decoder** to read it!

✅ **Example: Decoding "Hello"**

```js
console.log(buf.toString('utf-8'));
```

🔹 **Output:**

```plaintext
Hello
```

Now it’s back to normal text! 🎉

---

## **5️⃣ Encoding Files in Node.js (Like a Secret Diary 📖🔒)**

We can **save** text in a file using encoding.

✅ **Example: Writing a File with Encoding**

```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFileSync('example.txt', 'Hello World', 'utf-8');
console.log('File saved!');
```

- Saves `"Hello World"` in **UTF-8 format** in `example.txt`.

✅ **Example: Reading the File**

```js
const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf-8');
console.log(data); // Output: Hello World
```

- Reads the file back in **normal letters**.

---

## **6️⃣ Special Encoding: Base64 (Like a Spy Code 🕵️‍♂️)**

🔹 **Sometimes, we need to send pictures or secret messages.** We use **Base64** encoding for that!

✅ **Example: Encoding a Word in Base64**

```js
const encoded = Buffer.from('Hello').toString('base64');
console.log(encoded);
```

🔹 **Output:**

```plaintext
SGVsbG8=
```

💡 Now "Hello" looks like a **secret spy code!** 🕵️‍♂️

✅ **Decoding Base64 Back to Normal**

```js
const decoded = Buffer.from(encoded, 'base64').toString('utf-8');
console.log(decoded);
```

🔹 **Output:**

```plaintext
Hello
```

💡 The computer **translates it back**! 🎉

---

## **7️⃣ Which Encoding Should You Use?**

|**Situation**|**Encoding Type**|
|---|---|
|Normal text|`utf-8` (Default)|
|Storing small English words|`ascii`|
|Sending pictures or files|`base64`|
|Storing secret codes|`hex`|

---

## **📝 Final Summary**

- **Character Set** = Like an **alphabet** (ASCII, UTF-8).
- **Encoding** = A **secret code** for computers (UTF-8, Base64).
- **Node.js `Buffer`** = Helps convert text to and from these codes.
- **Files need encoding** so they can be saved and read properly.

💡 **Just like spies use secret codes, computers use encoding to store and share information!** 🕵️✨


# Streams & Buffers in Node.js

### **1️⃣ Buffer (Temporary Storage 📦)**

A **Buffer** is a small, temporary storage space in **memory (RAM)** used to hold data before it’s processed.

💡 **Think of a Buffer like a Bucket**:

- If you are **filling a tank with water using a bucket**, you can only carry a **limited** amount of water at a time.
- Similarly, **Buffers store small chunks of data** before they are processed.

#### **🔹 Creating a Buffer in Node.js**

```js
const buffer = Buffer.from("Hello");
console.log(buffer);
```

🔹 **Output:**

```plaintext
<Buffer 48 65 6c 6c 6f>
```

- `"Hello"` is stored as numbers: `H = 48`, `e = 65`, `l = 6c`, etc.

---

### **2️⃣ Stream (Data Flow 🚀)**

A **Stream** is a way to process data **in chunks** instead of loading everything at once.

💡 **Think of a Stream like a Pipe**:

- If you want to **fill a swimming pool**, you don’t pour all the water at once.
- Instead, you **keep adding water little by little** (this is what a Stream does).

#### **🔹 Types of Streams**

|**Type**|**Example**|
|---|---|
|**Readable**|Reading a file|
|**Writable**|Writing to a file|
|**Duplex**|Network sockets (both read & write)|
|**Transform**|Modifying data (e.g., compression)|

---

### **3️⃣ Why Use Them?**

🚀 **They help handle large amounts of data efficiently.**

- **Without Streams** → You download the whole file first.
- **With Streams** → You start processing immediately while loading.

✅ **Better Performance** → Less memory usage.  
✅ **Faster Processing** → Works in chunks instead of waiting for everything.

---

### **4️⃣ Buffers & Streams Together**

✔️ **Streams read data in chunks → Buffers store temporary data → Streams send data further.**

✅ **Example: Reading a Large File Without Blocking**

```js
const fs = require("fs");

const readableStream = fs.createReadStream("bigfile.txt", "utf-8");

readableStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log("Received chunk:", chunk);
});

readableStream.on("end", () => {
    console.log("Finished reading file");
});
```

🔹 **Why is this better?**

- **Does not load the whole file at once** (saves memory).
- **Processes data in chunks** (faster).

---

### **📝 Summary**

|**Feature**|**Buffer**|**Stream**|
|---|---|---|
|**What is it?**|Temporary storage in memory|Continuous flow of data|
|**Example**|Storing file data before processing|Playing a YouTube video|
|**Size**|Fixed|Processes in chunks|
|**Performance**|Uses more memory|Uses less memory|
|**Use Case**|Storing small data like images|Handling large files, videos, or network data|

---

### **🎯 When to Use What?**

✅ **Use Buffers when:**

- Storing **small** chunks of data **before processing**.
- Working with **binary data** like images or files.

✅ **Use Streams when:**

- Handling **large files** (videos, music, etc.).
- Processing **live data** (chats, logs, network requests).



# Difference Between CJS (CommonJS) and ESM (ES Modules) in Node.js

Node.js supports two module systems: **CommonJS (CJS)** and **ES Modules (ESM)**. Let’s break it down for a beginner.

---

### 1. **CommonJS (CJS)**

- **Older module system** used by default in Node.js.
- Based on `require()` for importing and `module.exports` for exporting.
- Simple and widely used, especially in older projects.

#### Example of CommonJS

**File: `math.js` (Module to Export)**

```javascript
// Exporting functions
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}

// Exporting the functions
module.exports = { add, subtract };
```

**File: `app.js` (Main File to Import)**

```javascript
// Importing using require
const math = require('./math');

// Using the functions
console.log(math.add(5, 3));      // Output: 8
console.log(math.subtract(10, 7)); // Output: 3
```

---

### 2. **ES Modules (ESM)**

- **Newer module system**, introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6).
- Uses `import` for importing and `export` for exporting.
- More modern and supports tree-shaking (removing unused code during bundling).

#### Example of ES Modules

**File: `math.mjs` (Module to Export)**

```javascript
// Exporting functions
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

export function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}
```

**File: `app.mjs` (Main File to Import)**

```javascript
// Importing using import
import { add, subtract } from './math.mjs';

// Using the functions
console.log(add(5, 3));      // Output: 8
console.log(subtract(10, 7)); // Output: 3
```

---

### Key Differences

| Feature             | **CommonJS (CJS)**            | **ES Modules (ESM)**                                      |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Import Syntax**   | `require()`                   | `import`                                                  |
| **Export Syntax**   | `module.exports` or `exports` | `export` or `export default`                              |
| **File Extension**  | `.js`                         | `.mjs` or `.js` (with `type: "module"` in `package.json`) |
| **When to Use**     | Works by default in Node.js   | Requires explicit setup (e.g., `"type": "module"`)        |
| **Dynamic Imports** | Not supported                 | Supported using `import()`                                |

---

### Key Notes for Beginners:

6. **Default Behavior in Node.js**:
    
    - Node.js uses **CommonJS** by default.
    - To use **ESM**, you must add `"type": "module"` to your `package.json` or use `.mjs` file extensions.
7. **When to Use What**:
    
    - Use **CJS** for older projects or when working with existing CommonJS modules.
    - Use **ESM** for modern projects as it is future-proof and aligned with the browser's module system.

---

### Example Combining Both

**If you want to mix CJS and ESM** in the same project:

- Use dynamic imports in CommonJS:

```javascript
(async () => {
  const { add, subtract } = await import('./math.mjs');
  console.log(add(5, 3));      // Output: 8
})();
```

- Or require in ESM:

```javascript
import cjsModule from './math.cjs';
console.log(cjsModule.add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
```

---

### Conclusion

CJS is great for compatibility, but ESM is the future. Start with **CJS** if you're new, then gradually adopt **ESM** for modern, scalable projects!




# What is a URL?  

A **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** is the **address of a webpage or file on the internet**. It tells your web browser **where to go** to find a specific website, image, video, or document.

Think of it like the **address of a house** in a city, but for websites! 🏠🌐

---

### **📌 Example of a URL**

```plaintext
https://www.example.com/products?category=shoes
```

---

## **🔹 Parts of a URL (Explained Simply)**

|**Part**|**Example**|**What it Does?**|
|---|---|---|
|**Protocol**|`https://`|Defines how data is sent (HTTP/HTTPS)|
|**Domain Name**|`www.example.com`|The website’s address|
|**Path**|`/products`|A specific page on the website|
|**Query Params**|`?category=shoes`|Extra information like filters|

---

## **🔹 Breaking It Down Further**

1️⃣ **Protocol (`https://`)**

- This tells the browser how to **communicate** with the website.
- **Common ones:**
    - `http://` (Not secure ❌)
    - `https://` (Secure ✅)

2️⃣ **Domain Name (`www.example.com`)**

- The **main name** of the website.
- Example: `google.com`, `amazon.com`, `facebook.com`.

3️⃣ **Path (`/products`)**

- Leads to a **specific page** inside the website.
- Example:
    - `/home` → Homepage
    - `/about` → About Us page

4️⃣ **Query Parameters (`?category=shoes`)**

- **Extra details** added after `?`.
- Helps filter or search for something.
- Example:
    - `?search=laptop` → Search for "laptop"
    - `?sort=price&order=asc` → Sort by price (low to high)

---

## **🔹 Real-World Example**

👉 Imagine **Amazon's search page**:

```plaintext
https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartphone
```

- **Domain**: `www.amazon.com`
- **Path**: `/s` (search page)
- **Query Parameter**: `k=smartphone` (Searches for "smartphone")

---

## **🔹 Why is a URL Important?**

✔ **Tells browsers where to go**  
✔ **Used in APIs to get/send data**  
✔ **Helps navigate websites**

Would you like to see **how URLs work in coding** with JavaScript? 🚀
# URL Module in Node.js

The `url` module in Node.js provides utilities for working with URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). It helps you parse, format, and resolve URLs in your application.

---

### Importing the URL Module

To use the `url` module, you must first import it:

```javascript
const url = require('url'); // CommonJS
```

Or, if you're using ES modules:

```javascript
import { URL } from 'url'; // ES Modules
```

---

### Basic Usage of URL Module

#### 1. **Parsing a URL**

The `URL` class allows you to parse a URL string into its components.

```javascript
const { URL } = require('url'); // Import URL class

// Create a URL object
const myUrl = new URL('https://example.com:8080/path/name?search=test#hash');

console.log(myUrl.href);        // Output: 'https://example.com:8080/path/name?search=test#hash'
console.log(myUrl.protocol);    // Output: 'https:'
console.log(myUrl.hostname);    // Output: 'example.com'
console.log(myUrl.port);        // Output: '8080'
console.log(myUrl.pathname);    // Output: '/path/name'
console.log(myUrl.search);      // Output: '?search=test'
console.log(myUrl.hash);        // Output: '#hash'
```

---

#### 2. **Building a URL**

You can construct a URL using the `URL` class.

```javascript
const { URL } = require('url');

const myUrl = new URL('https://example.com');
myUrl.pathname = '/new/path';
myUrl.search = '?query=123';
myUrl.hash = '#top';

console.log(myUrl.toString());
// Output: 'https://example.com/new/path?query=123#top'
```

---

#### 3. **Working with Query Parameters**

The `URLSearchParams` object makes it easy to manipulate query strings.

```javascript
const { URL } = require('url');

const myUrl = new URL('https://example.com?name=John&age=30');

// Get query parameters
console.log(myUrl.searchParams.get('name')); // Output: 'John'
console.log(myUrl.searchParams.get('age'));  // Output: '30'

// Add a new parameter
myUrl.searchParams.append('country', 'India');
console.log(myUrl.search); // Output: '?name=John&age=30&country=India'

// Loop through all parameters
myUrl.searchParams.forEach((value, key) => {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
});
// Output:
// name: John
// age: 30
// country: India
```

---

#### 4. **Resolving URLs**

The `url.resolve()` function (in CommonJS) resolves a target URL relative to a base URL.

```javascript
const url = require('url');

const base = 'https://example.com/path/';
const relative = 'subpath/file.html';

console.log(url.resolve(base, relative));
// Output: 'https://example.com/path/subpath/file.html'
```

In ES Modules, you would work directly with `URL`.

---

### Key Points:

- **Parsing:** Breaks a URL into components like protocol, host, pathname, etc.
- **Building:** Helps modify or construct URLs dynamically.
- **Query Parameters:** Easily handle query strings with `URLSearchParams`.
- **Resolving:** Helps derive full URLs from relative paths.

---

### Summary:

The `url` module simplifies handling URLs in your Node.js application, whether you need to analyze, modify, or build them. With its built-in utilities, you can handle URLs with minimal effort and robust support for query strings and relative paths.


# Query Parameters

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt-AsZh5woE   watch this for clear understanding


In Node.js, query parameters are used to send additional data in the URL. They are commonly used in APIs and web applications to pass information to the server.

## Accessing Query Parameters in Node.js

Query parameters are found in the URL after the `?` symbol, with key-value pairs separated by `&`.

### 1. Using Express.js

If you're using **Express.js**, you can access query parameters using `req.query`:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
    const keyword = req.query.keyword; // Access query parameter 'keyword'
    const page = req.query.page; // Access query parameter 'page'
    res.send(`Searching for: ${keyword}, Page: ${page}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

### Example Request:

```
http://localhost:3000/search?keyword=nodejs&page=2
```

### Output:

```
Searching for: nodejs, Page: 2
```

---

### 2. Using Native Node.js (Without Express)

If you're not using Express, you can use the built-in `url` module:

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const url = require('url');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    const queryObject = url.parse(req.url, true).query;
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end(`Keyword: ${queryObject.keyword}, Page: ${queryObject.page}`);
});

server.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

### Example Request:

```
http://localhost:3000/?keyword=nodejs&page=2
```

### Output:

```
Keyword: nodejs, Page: 2
```

---

## Summary:

- **Express.js**: Use `req.query` to access query parameters.
- **Native Node.js**: Use `url.parse(req.url, true).query` to extract parameters.

# Query and Path Parameters in a URL

When working with **URLs in web development**, we often pass **data** using **query parameters** and **path parameters**. These help in identifying resources and sending extra information in API requests.

---

## **🔹 Path Parameters (Path Params)**

### **📌 What Are They?**

Path parameters are **part of the URL itself** and are used to identify a **specific resource**. They are **required** and cannot be omitted.

### **📌 Example**

👉 URL:

```plaintext
https://example.com/users/123
```

👉 Here, **`123` is a path parameter** that represents a **specific user**.

### **📌 In an API (Express.js Example)**

```javascript
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
    const userId = req.params.id; // Extracts 'id' from the URL
    res.send(`User ID: ${userId}`);
});
```

✔️ If you visit `/users/45`, the server will return **"User ID: 45"**.

---

## **🔹 Query Parameters (Query Params)**

### **📌 What Are They?**

Query parameters are **optional key-value pairs** added to a URL after a **`?` (question mark)**. They help in **filtering, searching, and modifying results**.

### **📌 Example**

👉 URL:

```plaintext
https://example.com/users?name=John&age=25
```

👉 **Query parameters**:

- `name=John` (Search users with the name "John")
- `age=25` (Filter users who are 25 years old)

### **📌 In an API (Express.js Example)**

```javascript
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
    const name = req.query.name;
    const age = req.query.age;
    res.send(`Searching for users with Name: ${name}, Age: ${age}`);
});
```

✔️ If you visit `/users?name=John&age=25`, the server will return **"Searching for users with Name: John, Age: 25"**.

---

## **🔹 Key Differences**

|Feature|**Path Params** 🛣|**Query Params** 🔍|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Identify a **specific resource**|Modify/filter data|
|**Required?**|✅ Yes (mandatory)|❌ No (optional)|
|**Format**|`/users/:id` → `/users/123`|`/users?name=John&age=25`|
|**Use Case**|CRUD operations on a single item (GET, PUT, DELETE)|Searching, filtering, pagination|

---

## **🔹 Example Using Both Path & Query Parameters**

```http
GET /users/123/orders?status=pending&limit=5
```

- **Path Param:** `/users/123` → Get orders for **User 123**
- **Query Params:** `status=pending&limit=5` → Show only **5 pending** orders

---

## **✅ When to Use What?**

✔ **Use Path Params** when **identifying a unique resource** (`/users/123`).  
✔ **Use Query Params** for **optional filters, sorting, and pagination** (`?limit=10&sort=asc`).

# Event Module in Node.js

The **Event Module** in Node.js allows you to handle and trigger custom events. It is built on the **EventEmitter** class, which provides methods to work with events like listening for events and emitting them.

---

### How to Use the Event Module

8. **Import the Event Module**  
    To use the event module, you need to import the `events` package.
    
    ```javascript
    const EventEmitter = require('events');
    ```
    
9. **Create an EventEmitter Object**  
    You create an instance of the `EventEmitter` class to manage events.
    
    ```javascript
    const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();
    ```
    

---

### Basic Example: Listening and Emitting Events

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');

// Create an EventEmitter instance
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// Define an event listener
eventEmitter.on('greet', (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
});

// Emit the event
eventEmitter.emit('greet', 'Alice'); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

- **`on()`**: Registers an event listener for the `greet` event.
- **`emit()`**: Triggers the `greet` event and passes arguments (`'Alice'`).

---

### Example: Multiple Listeners for an Event

You can have multiple listeners for the same event.

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');

const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// First listener
eventEmitter.on('dataReceived', () => {
  console.log('Listener 1: Data received successfully.');
});

// Second listener
eventEmitter.on('dataReceived', () => {
  console.log('Listener 2: Processing the data.');
});

// Emit the event
eventEmitter.emit('dataReceived');
// Output:
// Listener 1: Data received successfully.
// Listener 2: Processing the data.
```

---

### Example: Remove an Event Listener

You can remove listeners using the `off()` or `removeListener()` method.

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');

const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

const listener = () => {
  console.log('This listener will be removed.');
};

// Attach the listener
eventEmitter.on('removeMe', listener);

// Emit the event
eventEmitter.emit('removeMe'); // Output: This listener will be removed.

// Remove the listener
eventEmitter.off('removeMe', listener);

// Emit the event again
eventEmitter.emit('removeMe'); // No output
```

---

### Example: One-Time Event Listener

The `once()` method listens for an event only once.

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');

const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

eventEmitter.once('welcome', () => {
  console.log('Welcome! This will only be shown once.');
});

// Emit the event twice
eventEmitter.emit('welcome'); // Output: Welcome! This will only be shown once.
eventEmitter.emit('welcome'); // No output
```

---

### Example: Handling Errors with Events

The `error` event is a special event that Node.js uses to report errors.

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');

const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// Error event listener
eventEmitter.on('error', (err) => {
  console.log(`Error: ${err.message}`);
});

// Emit an error event
eventEmitter.emit('error', new Error('Something went wrong!')); 
// Output: Error: Something went wrong!
```

---

### Summary of Common Methods:

|Method|Description|
|---|---|
|**on(event, listener)**|Adds a listener for a specific event.|
|**emit(event, args)**|Triggers an event and sends arguments to it.|
|**once(event, listener)**|Adds a one-time listener for an event.|
|**off(event, listener)**|Removes a listener for an event.|
|**removeAllListeners(event)**|Removes all listeners for an event.|

---

### Why Use the Event Module?

- Simplifies handling asynchronous operations.
- Allows you to decouple event handling logic from other parts of your code.
- Enables modular and scalable application designs.

---

### Real-World Example: A Custom Logger

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');

class Logger extends EventEmitter {
  log(message) {
    console.log(`Log: ${message}`);
    this.emit('logEvent', { id: 1, message });
  }
}

const logger = new Logger();

// Add a listener for log events
logger.on('logEvent', (data) => {
  console.log('Listener received:', data);
});

// Use the logger
logger.log('This is a custom event system.');
// Output:
// Log: This is a custom event system.
// Listener received: { id: 1, message: 'This is a custom event system.' }
```

The **Event Module** is widely used in Node.js applications, especially for server-related tasks and custom event handling.


# HTTP module 

The `http` module in Node.js is a built-in module that allows developers to create and manage web servers and handle HTTP requests and responses. It forms the backbone of web development with Node.js by enabling communication between clients (like browsers) and servers.

### What is HTTP?

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the web. It allows browsers and servers to exchange information using requests (from the client) and responses (from the server).

### Why Use the `http` Module?

The `http` module lets you:

- Build simple web servers.
- Handle incoming HTTP requests.
- Send HTTP responses to clients.

### How to Use the `http` Module?

#### 1. Import the Module

To use the `http` module, you must first require it:

```javascript
const http = require('http');
```

#### 2. Create a Simple Server

You can create a server using `http.createServer()` and specify a callback function to handle requests and responses.

```javascript
const http = require('http');

// Create a server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Set the response header and status code
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  // Send a response to the client
  res.end('Hello, World!');
});

// Start the server on port 3000
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

- **req**: Represents the incoming request from the client.
- **res**: Represents the response to be sent back to the client.
- server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running at http://localhost:3000/');
     });   
     for the explanation of this code click here [[server.listen()]]

#### 3. Responding to Specific Routes

You can check the URL of the incoming request and respond accordingly.

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url === '/') {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('Welcome to the homepage!');
  } else if (req.url === '/about') {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('This is the about page.');
  } else {
    res.writeHead(404, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('Page not found');
  }
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

### How the Code Works

10. **`req.url`**: Checks the requested URL.
11. **`res.writeHead()`**: Sets the HTTP status code and response headers.
12. **`res.end()`**: Sends the response back to the client and ends the connection.

### Sending JSON Data

The `http` module can also send JSON responses.

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url === '/api') {
    const data = { message: 'Hello, this is JSON!' };
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
    res.end(JSON.stringify(data));
  } else {
    res.writeHead(404, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('Route not found');
  }
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

### Key Points for Beginners

13. **Built-In Module**: No need to install; it's included in Node.js by default.
14. **Starts a Server**: The server listens for requests on a specified port.
15. **Handles Requests**: `req` contains details about the client's request.
16. **Sends Responses**: `res` is used to send data back to the client.

### Summary

The `http` module is a foundational tool in Node.js for building web servers. It's simple to use and highly flexible, allowing developers to handle HTTP requests and responses efficiently.




# Understanding Node.js Streams and Pipes 

In Node.js, **streams** and **pipes** are used to efficiently handle large amounts of data without loading everything into memory at once. Think of them like **water flowing through a pipe**—you don’t need to collect all the water before it reaches the other end.

---

## **1. What are Streams in Node.js?**

A **stream** is a continuous flow of data that can be processed piece by piece instead of waiting for the entire data to load. This is **memory-efficient** and **faster** for large files or data sources like HTTP requests, files, and databases.

### **Types of Streams**

1. **Readable Streams** → Used to read data (e.g., reading a file).
2. **Writable Streams** → Used to write data (e.g., writing to a file).
3. **Duplex Streams** → Can both read and write (e.g., sockets).
4. **Transform Streams** → Modify data while streaming (e.g., compressing a file).

---

## **2. Example of Readable Stream**

Let's read a file using a readable stream.

### **Without Stream (Loads Full File into Memory)**

```js
const fs = require("fs");

fs.readFile("bigfile.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
});
```

🔴 **Problem:** If `bigfile.txt` is huge, it loads everything into memory, causing performance issues.

### **With Stream (Reads in Chunks)**

```js
const fs = require("fs");

const readStream = fs.createReadStream("bigfile.txt", "utf8");

readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log("Received chunk:", chunk);
});

readStream.on("end", () => {
    console.log("File reading completed.");
});
```

✅ **Solution:** It processes the file **chunk by chunk** instead of loading it all at once.

---

## **3. Example of Writable Stream**

Writing to a file using a writable stream:

```js
const fs = require("fs");

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("output.txt");

writeStream.write("Hello, world!\n");
writeStream.write("Streaming data...\n");
writeStream.end();  // Signals that writing is complete

writeStream.on("finish", () => {
    console.log("Writing completed.");
});
```

✅ **Benefit:** Data is written **progressively**, making it **efficient** for large files.

---

## **4. What are Pipes in Node.js?**

A **pipe** in Node.js is a method used to connect **one stream to another**. It allows data to **flow automatically** from a **readable stream** to a **writable stream** without manually handling data chunks.

Think of it like **a water pipeline**:

- Water **(data)** flows from the **source** (readable stream).
- Travels **through a pipe** (pipe method).
- Ends up in the **sink** (writable stream).

---

## **📌 Why Use Pipes?**

✔ **Simplifies stream handling** (no need for manual `data` event listeners).  
✔ **Efficient memory usage** (processes data in chunks, no full buffering).  
✔ **Chaining** (connect multiple pipes together, like compression + writing).




**Pipes** allow you to **connect streams** directly. Instead of manually handling chunks with `.on("data")`, you can **pipe** a readable stream into a writable stream.

### **Example: Using Pipe to Copy a File**

```js
const fs = require("fs");

const readStream = fs.createReadStream("input.txt");
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("output.txt");

// Pipe the read stream into the write stream
readStream.pipe(writeStream);

writeStream.on("finish", () => {
    console.log("File copied successfully!");
});
```

✅ **Benefit:** `pipe()` automatically handles chunk transfer **without buffering the entire file**.

---

## **5. Example: Compress a File Using Transform Stream**

A **transform stream** can **modify data** while passing it through a stream, like **compressing a file**.

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const zlib = require("zlib");

const readStream = fs.createReadStream("input.txt");
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("input.txt.gz");
const gzip = zlib.createGzip();  // Compression transform stream

// Compress the file
readStream.pipe(gzip).pipe(writeStream);

writeStream.on("finish", () => {
    console.log("File compressed successfully!");
});
```

✅ **Benefit:** The file is read, compressed, and written **simultaneously**, making it **super efficient**.

---

## **6. Example: HTTP Server Using Streams**

A web server that **streams** file content instead of loading it all at once:

```js
const http = require("http");
const fs = require("fs");

http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
    const readStream = fs.createReadStream("bigfile.txt");
    readStream.pipe(res);  // Streams file directly to response
}).listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("Server running on http://localhost:3000");
});
```

✅ **Benefit:** Handles **large files efficiently** without overloading the server.

# why objects can't be sent as a response to client
In web development, **objects** (like JavaScript objects) cannot be sent directly as a response to the client because HTTP communication is based on **text-based protocols**. Data sent over HTTP must be serialized into a format that can be transmitted as text, such as **JSON**, **XML**, or plain text.

---

### **Why Objects Can't Be Sent Directly**
1. **HTTP is Text-Based**: HTTP requests and responses are transmitted as text. Objects are binary or complex data structures that cannot be directly represented as text.
2. **Serialization Needed**: To send an object, it must first be converted (serialized) into a text-based format like JSON or XML.
3. **Client-Side Parsing**: The client (e.g., a browser) needs to receive data in a format it can understand and parse back into an object.

---

### **Solution: Serialize the Object**
To send an object to the client, you need to **serialize** it into a text-based format. The most common format is **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation), which is lightweight and easy to parse.

---

### **Steps to Send an Object as a Response**
4. **Serialize the Object**: Convert the object into a JSON string using `JSON.stringify()`.
5. **Set the Response Headers**: Indicate the content type (e.g., `application/json`) so the client knows how to interpret the data.
6. **Send the Response**: Send the serialized data as the response body.

---

### **Example in Node.js**

Here’s how you can send an object as a JSON response in a Node.js server:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url === '/data') {
    // Create an object
    const data = {
      name: 'Alice',
      age: 30,
      city: 'Wonderland'
    };

    // Serialize the object to JSON
    const jsonData = JSON.stringify(data);

    // Set the response headers
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });

    // Send the JSON response
    res.end(jsonData);
  } else {
    res.writeHead(404, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('Page Not Found');
  }
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

---

### **What Happens on the Client Side?**
When the client (e.g., a browser) receives the JSON response, it can **parse** the JSON string back into a JavaScript object using `JSON.parse()`.

#### Example in a Browser:
```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3000/data')
  .then(response => response.json()) // Parse JSON response
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data); // { name: 'Alice', age: 30, city: 'Wonderland' }
  });
```

---

### **Alternative Formats**
If JSON is not suitable, you can use other formats like:
7. **XML**: Useful for legacy systems or specific use cases.
8. **Plain Text**: For simple responses.
9. **Binary Formats**: For sending files or binary data (e.g., images, videos).

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- Objects must be serialized into a text-based format (like JSON) before sending them over HTTP.
- The client can then parse the response back into an object.
- JSON is the most common format for sending and receiving data in modern web applications.



# Sending an HTML File Using Node.js (`http` and `fs` modules)

```js
const http = require("http");
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    // Set the file path
    const filePath = path.join(__dirname, "index.html");

    // Read the HTML file
    fs.readFile(filePath, (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
            res.writeHead(500, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
            res.end("Internal Server Error");
        } else {
            res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
            res.end(data);
        }
    });
});

// Start the server
const PORT = 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

---

### **📌 Explanation:**

1. The `http.createServer()` method creates a simple HTTP server.
2. When a request comes in:
    - The server reads `index.html` from the same directory using `fs.readFile()`.
    - If an error occurs (e.g., file not found), it responds with a `500 Internal Server Error`.
    - Otherwise, it sets the **Content-Type** to `"text/html"` and sends the file content as a response.
3. The server **listens on port 3000**, and you can access it via **`http://localhost:3000`**.

---

### **📌 Handling Different Routes (Multiple Pages)**

If you want to serve multiple HTML files based on different routes:

```js
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    let filePath = path.join(__dirname, "index.html");

    if (req.url === "/about") {
        filePath = path.join(__dirname, "about.html");
    } else if (req.url === "/contact") {
        filePath = path.join(__dirname, "contact.html");
    }

    fs.readFile(filePath, (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
            res.writeHead(404, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
            res.end("404 - Page Not Found");
        } else {
            res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
            res.end(data);
        }
    });
});
```

---

### **📌 Best Practices**

✔ If you're serving many static files, consider using **Express.js** for better performance and maintainability.  
✔ Always set **Content-Type** to `"text/html"` for proper rendering in the browser.  
✔ If the HTML file is large, use **streaming (`fs.createReadStream()`)** for better performance.

# **What is JSON?**

JSON stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**. It is a lightweight, human-readable **data format** used for sharing and storing information. JSON is widely used in modern web development because it is easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate.

---

### **Key Features of JSON:**

4. **Lightweight:** Compact and simple.
5. **Human-Readable:** Looks like plain text and is easy to understand.
6. **Language-Independent:** While derived from JavaScript, it is supported by almost all programming languages (Python, Java, Node.js, etc.).
7. **Structured Data:** Organizes data in a key-value pair format, similar to JavaScript objects.

---

### **Basic Structure of JSON:**

- **Key-Value Pairs:** JSON uses keys and values.
    - Keys are strings.
    - Values can be strings, numbers, arrays, objects, or `true`, `false`, `null`.

#### **Example JSON Data:**

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25,
  "isStudent": false,
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "HTML", "CSS"],
  "address": {
    "city": "New York",
    "zip": "10001"
  }
}
```

---

### **What is JSON Used For?**

JSON is primarily used to **transfer and store data** in a structured way.

#### 1. **Data Exchange**

- JSON is commonly used for sending data between a client (browser) and a server (backend).
- Example: When you visit a website, the server might send data (like product details) to your browser in JSON format.

#### 2. **Configuration Files**

- JSON is used to store settings and configurations for applications.
- Example: `package.json` in Node.js applications stores project dependencies.

#### 3. **APIs**

- Many web services and APIs (like those from Google, Twitter, or Facebook) use JSON to exchange data.
- Example: A weather API might return the current temperature and conditions in JSON format.

#### 4. **Databases**

- NoSQL databases like MongoDB use JSON-like structures to store data.

---

### **Why is JSON So Popular?**

8. **Simplicity:** Easy to write and understand.
9. **Versatility:** Can be used with almost any programming language.
10. **Efficiency:** Lightweight, which makes data transfer fast.
11. **Compatibility:** Works seamlessly with JavaScript, making it ideal for modern web apps.

---

### **How JSON is Used in Practice?**

#### Example: Sending JSON from a Server

A server can send JSON data to a client (browser):

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Laptop",
  "price": 1200,
  "inStock": true
}
```

#### Example: Parsing JSON in JavaScript

```javascript
const jsonString = '{"name":"Alice","age":25}';

// Convert JSON string to JavaScript object
const data = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(data.name); // Output: Alice

// Convert JavaScript object to JSON string
const jsonOutput = JSON.stringify({ name: "Bob", age: 30 });
console.log(jsonOutput); // Output: '{"name":"Bob","age":30}'
```

---

### **Summary**

- JSON is a **format** for representing data.
- It is widely used for **data exchange** between systems, **storage**, and **configuration**.
- It is simple, versatile, and essential for modern web and software development.

# **Difference between json file and a json string

Here’s a beginner-friendly explanation of the difference between a **JSON file** and a **JSON string**:

---

### **1. JSON String**

A **JSON string** is **JSON-formatted data** represented as a **text string** inside your code. It’s just a piece of text that looks like JSON.

#### **Key Characteristics:**

- It is **not a file**—it exists only as a string in your program.
- It is typically enclosed in double quotes (`"`).
- You use it when exchanging data between systems (e.g., sending or receiving data from an API).

#### **Example of a JSON String:**

```javascript
const jsonString = '{"name":"Alice","age":25}';
```

This is a string that happens to follow the JSON format.

---

### **2. JSON File**

A **JSON file** is a physical file that **stores JSON data**. It’s a text file saved on your computer or server with the `.json` file extension.

#### **Key Characteristics:**

- It contains JSON data in text format.
- It can be read or written to by programs.
- Useful for configuration files, data storage, or passing data between systems.

#### **Example of a JSON File (`data.json`):**

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25
}
```

This is a **file** saved on your disk that contains JSON data.

---

### **Differences Between JSON File and JSON String**

|**Aspect**|**JSON String**|**JSON File**|
|---|---|---|
|**Where it exists**|Inside a program or in memory|As a physical file with `.json` extension|
|**Usage**|For exchanging or working with JSON data in code|For storing data, configurations, or sharing|
|**Accessed by**|Directly used in the code|Read/written to/from the file system|
|**Example**|`'{"name":"Alice","age":25}'`|A file with the same content as above|

---

### **How They Work Together**

You can **read a JSON file** into your program and convert it to a **JSON string**, or you can take a JSON string and save it as a JSON file.

#### Example in Node.js:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Reading a JSON file
const jsonFileContent = fs.readFileSync('data.json', 'utf-8'); // Read file as a string
console.log(jsonFileContent); // Output: '{"name":"Alice","age":25}' (JSON string)

// Converting the JSON string to an object
const data = JSON.parse(jsonFileContent);
console.log(data.name); // Output: 'Alice'

// Writing an object to a JSON file
const newData = { name: "Bob", age: 30 };
fs.writeFileSync('newData.json', JSON.stringify(newData));
console.log("Data saved to file!");
```

---

### **Summary**

- **JSON String**: Used in code and data exchange.
- **JSON File**: Used to store or share JSON data as a file.
- You can easily convert between them using tools like `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` in JavaScript.
# **JSON.stringify & JSON.parse

In **Node.js** (or JavaScript in general), **`JSON.stringify`** and **`JSON.parse`** are methods used to work with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a lightweight format for storing and exchanging data. Here's a simple explanation for a newbie:

---

### **1. `JSON.stringify()`**

- **Purpose**: Converts a **JavaScript object** into a **JSON string**.
- **Why use it?**: When you want to send data (e.g., to an API) or save it somewhere (like in a file), it must be in text format (JSON string).

#### **Example:**

```javascript
const obj = { name: "John", age: 30 };

const jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj); // Convert object to JSON string
console.log(jsonString); // Output: '{"name":"John","age":30}'
```

- The `JSON.stringify()` method turns the `obj` object into a string (`'{"name":"John","age":30}'`).
- Now, you can store or send this `jsonString`.

---

### **2. `JSON.parse()`**

- **Purpose**: Converts a **JSON string** back into a **JavaScript object**.
- **Why use it?**: When you receive data (e.g., from an API) or read it from a file, it’s usually in text format (JSON string). You use `JSON.parse()` to convert it back into an object so you can work with it in your code.

#### **Example:**

```javascript
const jsonString = '{"name":"John","age":30}';

const obj = JSON.parse(jsonString); // Convert JSON string back to object
console.log(obj.name); // Output: 'John'
console.log(obj.age);  // Output: 30
```

- The `JSON.parse()` method turns the JSON string (`'{"name":"John","age":30}'`) back into an object (`{ name: "John", age: 30 }`).

---

### **When to Use Them Together**

If you want to save an object as a string and then retrieve it later, you’ll use both methods.

#### **Example:**

```javascript
const obj = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };

// Convert object to JSON string (e.g., saving it)
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj);

// Later, convert JSON string back to object (e.g., retrieving it)
const parsedObj = JSON.parse(jsonString);

console.log(parsedObj.name); // Output: 'Alice'
console.log(parsedObj.age);  // Output: 25
```

---

### **Key Points:**

12. **`JSON.stringify()`**: Turns an object into a string. Use it to save or send data.
13. **`JSON.parse()`**: Turns a JSON string back into an object. Use it to read or use the saved/sent data.
14. **JSON strings** must be in valid JSON format (e.g., keys in double quotes: `'{"key":"value"}'`).

That’s it! These are your tools for working with JSON in Node.js. 😊

# Understanding `res.writeHead` vs. `res.write` in Node.js HTTP Module

When building web servers with Node.js's `http` module, you'll frequently interact with the `res` (response) object to send data back to the client. Two commonly used methods are `res.writeHead` and `res.write`. Understanding the difference between them is crucial for effectively managing HTTP responses.

---

#### **1. `res.writeHead`**

**Purpose:**  
`res.writeHead` is used to send HTTP response headers and set the status code of the response. Headers contain metadata about the response, such as content type, status codes, and more.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
res.writeHead(statusCode, headers)
```

- **`statusCode`**: A numeric HTTP status code (e.g., `200` for OK, `404` for Not Found).
- **`headers`**: An object containing key-value pairs for HTTP headers.

**Example:**

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Set the status code to 200 (OK) and content type to text/plain
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  
  // Send the response body
  res.end('Hello, World!');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

**Explanation:**

- `res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });`  
    Sets the HTTP status code to `200` and specifies that the content type of the response is plain text.

---

#### **2. `res.write`**

**Purpose:**  
`res.write` is used to send a chunk of the response body to the client. It allows you to stream data in multiple parts rather than sending it all at once.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
res.write(chunk, encoding, callback)
```

- **`chunk`**: The data to send. It can be a string or a Buffer.
- **`encoding`**: (Optional) The encoding of the chunk if it's a string (e.g., `'utf8'`).
- **`callback`**: (Optional) A function to call once the chunk has been written.

**Example:**

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Set the status code and headers
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  
  // Write multiple chunks of data
  res.write('Hello, ');
  res.write('World!');
  
  // End the response
  res.end();
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

**Explanation:**

- `res.write('Hello, ');`  
    Sends the first part of the response body.
    
- `res.write('World!');`  
    Sends the second part of the response body.
    
- `res.end();`  
    Signals that all response data has been sent.
    

---

#### **Key Differences**

|**Feature**|**`res.writeHead`**|**`res.write`**|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Sets HTTP status code and headers|Sends a chunk of the response body|
|**When to Use**|At the beginning of the response|When sending data in parts during response|
|**Number of Calls**|Typically called once per response|Can be called multiple times per response|
|**Data Sent**|Metadata (headers) only|Actual content/data|
|**Relationship**|Must be called before `res.write` or `res.end`|Used after setting headers with `res.writeHead`|

---

#### **Combined Example**

Let's see both methods in action within a single server:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Step 1: Set status code and headers
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
  
  // Step 2: Write parts of the response body
  res.write('<html>');
  res.write('<head><title>Node.js HTTP Module</title></head>');
  res.write('<body>');
  res.write('<h1>Welcome to the Node.js HTTP Server!</h1>');
  res.write('<p>This response was sent using <code>res.writeHead</code> and <code>res.write</code>.</p>');
  res.write('</body>');
  res.write('</html>');
  
  // Step 3: End the response
  res.end();
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

**Explanation:**

15. **Setting Headers:**  
    `res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });`  
    Sets the response status to `200` and the content type to HTML.
    
16. **Writing Response Body:**  
    Multiple `res.write` calls build the HTML content incrementally.
    
17. **Ending Response:**  
    `res.end();`  
    Signals that the response is complete.
    

---

#### **Practical Tips for Beginners**

18. **Always Set Headers First:**  
    Before writing any data to the response body, set the necessary headers using `res.writeHead`. This ensures that the client knows how to interpret the incoming data.
    
19. **Use `res.end` to Finish the Response:**  
    After sending all necessary chunks with `res.write`, always call `res.end()` to indicate that the response is complete. You can also pass data directly to `res.end` if you prefer not to use `res.write`.
    
    **Example without `res.write`:**
    
    ```javascript
    const http = require('http');
    
    const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
      res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
      res.end('Hello, World!'); // Sends response and ends it
    });
    
    server.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Server is running at http://localhost:3000/');
    });
    ```
    
20. **Streaming Data:**  
    Use `res.write` when you need to send large amounts of data or stream data (e.g., serving a video or real-time updates).
    
    **Example: Streaming a Large File:**
    
    ```javascript
    const http = require('http');
    const fs = require('fs');
    
    const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
      const readStream = fs.createReadStream('largeFile.txt');
      
      res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
      
      readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
        res.write(chunk); // Send each chunk to the client
      });
      
      readStream.on('end', () => {
        res.end(); // End the response when file is fully read
      });
      
      readStream.on('error', (err) => {
        res.writeHead(500, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
        res.end('Server Error');
      });
    });
    
    server.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Server is running at http://localhost:3000/');
    });
    ```
    

---

#### **Conclusion**

- **`res.writeHead`**:
    
    - **Use it to set the HTTP status and headers.**
    - **Call it once at the beginning of your response.**
- **`res.write`**:
    
    - **Use it to send parts of the response body.**
    - **Call it multiple times if you need to send data in chunks.**

Understanding these two methods allows you to effectively manage HTTP responses, ensuring that your server communicates clearly and efficiently with clients.

---

Feel free to experiment with these methods to see how they work in different scenarios. Building small projects, like a simple web server or an API endpoint, can help reinforce these concepts.

# **What is `package.json`? 

### **🔹 Think of It Like a Shopping List 🛒**

Imagine you're building a **project** (a website or an app). To make your life easier, you need some **tools and ingredients** (libraries like React, Express, etc.).

Instead of **remembering everything manually**, you write it all down in **one file**—this file is called **`package.json`**!

---

## **🔹 What is `package.json`?**

It is a **special file in a Node.js project** that:  
✅ **Stores project information** (name, version, description)  
✅ **Lists dependencies** (the external packages your project needs)  
✅ **Defines scripts** (commands to run your project)  
✅ **Helps version control** (so others can install the same dependencies)

---

## **🔹 What Does It Look Like?**

A basic `package.json` file looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "my-awesome-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple project using Node.js",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",

### **🔹 Think of It Like a Recipe Book 📖**

Imagine you are baking a **cake** 🍰. You have a list of ingredients (`package.json`), but what if the ingredients **slightly change** every time you bake it?

🔹 `package-lock.json` **locks** the exact versions of each package so that every time you install them, you get the same results—just like following a **precise recipe**!

---

## **🔹 What Does `package-lock.json` Do?**

✅ **Locks dependency versions** – Ensures consistency across different installations.  
✅ **Speeds up installation** – Uses a cached package list for faster setup.  
✅ **Improves security** – Ensures you don’t get unexpected updates that may break your app.

## **🔹 How is It Different from `package.json`?**

|Feature|`package.json`|`package-lock.json`|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Lists the main dependencies|Locks the exact versions installed|
|**Versioning**|Allows version ranges (e.g., `^1.2.3`)|Stores exact versions (e.g., `1.2.4`)|
|**Commit to Git?**|Yes ✅|Yes ✅ (Important for consistency)|
|**Editable?**|Yes ✏️|No 🚫 (Generated automatically)|

## **🔹 Example of `package-lock.json`**

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": {
      "version": "4.18.2",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-4.18.2.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-abc123...",
      "dependencies": {
        "body-parser": {
          "version": "1.19.2",
          "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/body-parser/-/body-parser-1.19.2.tgz"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

📌 **Key Things in This File:**

- `"version"` → Exact version of installed packages
- `"resolved"` → Where the package was downloaded from
- `"integrity"` → Hash to verify package authenticity
- **Nested dependencies** → Ensures sub-packages also match exact versions

---

## **🔹 How Is It Used?**

1️⃣ When you run:

```sh
npm install
```

➡️ It reads `package-lock.json` and installs **exact** versions.

2️⃣ If another developer clones your project and runs:

```sh
npm ci
```

➡️ It installs packages **faster** using the locked versions.

---

## **🔹 Why Is It Important?**

✅ Ensures **all team members** get the same versions.  
✅ Prevents **accidental updates** that might break the app.  
✅ **Improves security** by verifying packages.

📌 **Never delete `package-lock.json`** unless you really know what you're doing! 🚀

# **Understanding Version Numbers (1.2.3 Format) 

The **1.2.3** format is called **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**. It follows the structure:

```
 MAJOR . MINOR . PATCH
```

### **🔹 What Do the Numbers Mean?**

|**Version Type**|**Example**|**What It Means?**|
|---|---|---|
|**MAJOR**|`1.0.0` → `2.0.0`|**Big changes**, may break old features 🚨|
|**MINOR**|`1.2.0` → `1.3.0`|**New features**, but backward-compatible 🎉|
|**PATCH**|`1.2.3` → `1.2.4`|**Bug fixes or small improvements** 🐛🔧|

---

## **🔹 Real-Life Example**

Let’s say you have an app **Version 2.4.7**:

|Update|New Version|What Changed?|
|---|---|---|
|**Fixed a small bug**|`2.4.8`|Just a patch update (bug fix)|
|**Added a new feature**|`2.5.0`|A minor update (new feature added)|
|**Major redesign**|`3.0.0`|A breaking change (old features may not work)|

---

## **🔹 Special Cases**

|**Version Type**|**Example**|**Meaning**|
|---|---|---|
|**Alpha (`-alpha`)**|`1.0.0-alpha`|Early testing version (unstable) ⚠️|
|**Beta (`-beta`)**|`1.0.0-beta`|Almost ready, but may have some bugs 🐞|
|**Release Candidate (`-rc`)**|`1.0.0-rc.1`|Final testing before public release 🚀|

---

## **🔹 Summary**

✅ `1.2.3` = **Major.Minor.Patch**  
✅ **Major** → Big changes, may break things 🚨  
✅ **Minor** → New features, but safe to upgrade 🎉  
✅ **Patch** → Bug fixes, small tweaks 🐛
