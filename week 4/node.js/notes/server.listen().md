The code snippet:

```javascript
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

is part of setting up a server using Node.js's `http` module. Letâ€™s break it down step by step in simple terms:

---

### **What is happening here?**

1. **`server.listen(3000)`**:
    - The `.listen()` method tells the server to start "listening" for incoming requests from clients.
    - The number `3000` is the **port number**. A port is like a "door" through which data enters or leaves your computer for the server. Port `3000` is commonly used for local development servers.
    - Essentially, it means: "Hey, server! Start listening for requests on port 3000."

---

2. **`() => { console.log(...) }`**:
    - This is a **callback function**. It's a piece of code that runs after the server successfully starts.
    - The `console.log('Server is running...')` statement prints a message to the terminal to let you know that the server is up and running. It's like a confirmation message saying, "Everything is set up, and the server is ready to accept requests."

---

3. **`http://localhost:3000/`**:
    - `localhost` is a special address that refers to your own computer. When you type `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, it tells your browser to send a request to the server running on your computer at port `3000`.

### **Simple Analogy**

Imagine you're setting up a customer service desk:

- **`server.listen(3000)`**:  
    You're opening a specific desk (port 3000) to receive customer queries.
    
- **Callback Function**:  
    After setting up the desk, you put up a sign saying, "Desk 3000 is open for business!"
    
- **`http://localhost:3000/`**:  
    This is like giving the location of the desk (your computer + port 3000). People (like your browser) can visit this desk to interact with your service.

### **What happens when you run this code?**

1. The server starts running.
2. It listens for incoming requests on port 3000.
3. When the server successfully starts, you see this message in your terminal:  
    `"Server is running at http://localhost:3000/"`.
4. You can open a browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the server.

### **In Summary**

- **`server.listen(3000)`**: Starts the server and makes it listen for requests on port 3000.
- **Callback Function**: Confirms when the server is successfully running.
- **`localhost:3000`**: Address you use to connect to the server.
